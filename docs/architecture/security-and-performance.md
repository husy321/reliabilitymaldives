# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers for XSS prevention
- Secure token storage in HttpOnly cookies
- Input validation and sanitization

**Backend Security:**
- Role-based access control with middleware
- Rate limiting and CORS policies
- Comprehensive input validation with Zod schemas

**Authentication Security:**
- NextAuth.js with 2-hour session timeout
- Bcrypt password hashing
- JWT tokens with role claims

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle size optimization with code splitting
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Client-side caching with React Query

**Backend Performance:**
- Database query optimization with strategic indexes
- Connection pooling through Neon PostgreSQL
- API response caching with Vercel KV
