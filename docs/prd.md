# Reliability Maldives Business Management System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable digital transformation from manual paper-based processes to streamlined digital workflows across all departments
- Implement unified single-window interface for receivables coordination between Sales and Accounts teams
- Create customer follow-up tracking system with conversation logging and automated due date notifications
- Enable customer statement generation and export for payables tracking and customer service
- Provide 30-second upload workflow with drag-and-drop functionality for invoices, POs, and delivery orders
- Implement approval workflow for sales reports with correction cycles (Manager upload → Accountant review → Manager correction if rejected)
- Integrate ZKT machine SDK for automated staff attendance tracking with admin override capabilities
- Support sequential HR-to-payroll workflow (Admin finalizes attendance → Accounts processes payroll)
- Enable "everything in one place" solution with role-based access and cross-team notifications
- Provide remote work capability for business continuity during travel and flexible work arrangements

### Background Context
Reliability Maldives currently operates with manual, paper-based processes across three critical business functions: receivables management, sales reporting, and human resources. The company faces significant operational inefficiencies where staff spend considerable time searching through physical documents, coordinating between departments, and managing customer follow-ups manually. The lack of digital accessibility prevents remote work capabilities that are essential for a small company where every person is critical for business continuity.

The receivables process requires coordination between Sales and Accounts teams for document uploads and customer follow-up management, including conversation logging and automated due date tracking. Sales reporting needs structured approval workflows where managers upload reports for accountant review, with correction cycles when reports are rejected. The HR function must integrate with ZKT attendance machines while allowing administrative adjustments, feeding into payroll processing handled by the Accounts team. Additionally, the company needs customer-facing capabilities including statement generation and export functionality for improved customer service and transparency.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Single-page workflow design optimized for speed and efficiency, eliminating the current "searching through 100 files" experience. The interface prioritizes role-based optimization where outlet managers get streamlined batch processing views while accountants receive split-screen interfaces for document comparison and review. The design philosophy centers on "everything in one place" with intuitive navigation that requires minimal training for small company staff.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Drag-and-drop file uploads** with visual feedback and automatic categorization
- **Single-window coordination** interfaces for cross-team collaboration
- **Batch processing workflows** for managers handling multiple documents
- **Split-screen review interfaces** for accountants comparing reports with supporting documents
- **Contextual notifications** appearing within relevant workflow areas
- **Quick action buttons** for common tasks (approve/reject, mark resolved, export)

### Core Screens and Views
- **Unified Dashboard** with role-based widgets and due date alerts
- **Receivables Management Screen** with integrated follow-up sub-tabs
- **Document Upload Interface** with drag-and-drop and automatic sorting
- **Sales Report Review Screen** with split-screen document comparison
- **Customers Screen** with integrated statement generation and export capabilities
- **HR Attendance Management Screen** with ZKT integration and manual override
- **Follow-up Tracking Interface** with conversation logging and filtering
- **Notification Center** for cross-team workflow updates

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Standard web accessibility compliance to ensure usability across different user capabilities and devices, particularly important for small company environment where staff may have varying technical comfort levels.

### Branding
Clean, professional business interface following standard business application conventions. Emphasis on clarity and efficiency over decorative elements, designed to reduce cognitive load during repetitive daily tasks.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Web-responsive design supporting desktop primary usage with mobile accessibility for remote work scenarios during business travel and field management needs.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing all modules (Receivables, Sales Reports, HR/Attendance) to enable shared components, consistent development patterns, and simplified deployment for small team maintenance.

### Service Architecture
**Monolith Architecture**: Given the small company context, integrated workflow requirements, and need for simple deployment/maintenance, a well-structured monolithic application will provide faster development, easier debugging, and lower operational complexity than microservices.

### Testing Requirements

**For Architecture Phase:**
1. **Validate 30-second upload target** - Test with actual file sizes and network conditions
2. **Design notification system architecture** - Real-time vs polling approaches
3. **Plan scheduled job implementation** - Next.js limitations and alternatives

**For Implementation:**
1. **Prioritize ZKT integration early** - Highest technical risk area
2. **Implement file upload MVP first** - Core functionality for all modules
3. **Test cross-team coordination workflows** - Critical business process validation

### Final Decision

**✅ READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The identified gaps are specification details that can be addressed during architecture phase rather than blockers to proceeding.

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt
"Review this PRD for a 3-module business management system with role-based interfaces. Design user experience flows focusing on single-window coordination, drag-and-drop uploads, and split-screen review interfaces. Priority: optimize for 30-second task completion and cross-team workflow efficiency."

### Architect Prompt  
"Create technical architecture for Next.js v14+ business management system using shadcn/ui v4. Key integrations: ZKT machine SDK, PostgreSQL with Prisma, role-based auth. Priority areas: file upload performance, real-time notifications, scheduled jobs. Focus on monolith architecture suitable for small team maintenance."
