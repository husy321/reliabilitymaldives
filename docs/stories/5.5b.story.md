### HR Attendance Service Requirements
[Source: architecture/components.md#hr-attendance-service]
**Approval Workflow Operations**:
- `applyManualOverride(employeeId, date, correction)` - Enhanced with approval workflow integration for significant adjustments
- New operations: `requiresApproval(editRequest)` - Business rule evaluation for threshold-based approval triggering
- `submitForApproval(recordId, editRequest, reason)` - Approval workflow initiation with notification integration
- `processApproval(approvalId, decision, comments)` - Approval decision processing with audit trail updates
- Dependencies: AttendanceRecord model (from Stories 5.1a-5.5a), AuditLog model, User model relationships, Notification Service
- Technology Stack: Prisma transactions for approval status updates, Next.js Server Actions, shadcn/ui approval forms

### Frontend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
**Component Organization**:
- Approval workflow components organized in src/components/business/attendance/ extending existing edit structure
- Integration with existing AttendanceEditModal for seamless approval workflow triggering
- New approval queue interface using shadcn/ui Table and Dialog components for professional approval management
- Enhanced audit trail display using existing component patterns with advanced filtering and search capabilities
- State management using Zustand for approval workflow state and real-time audit trail updates

### Data Model Requirements
[Source: types/attendance.ts and existing models]
**AttendanceRecord Approval Extensions**:
- Utilization of existing conflict resolution fields for approval status tracking (conflictResolved, conflictResolvedBy, conflictResolvedAt)
- New fields: approvalRequired: boolean, approvalStatus: 'PENDING' | 'APPROVED' | 'REJECTED', approvalComments: string
- Enhanced audit trail fields: editReason: string, editCategory: 'MINOR' | 'MAJOR', thresholdTriggered: boolean
- Integration with existing AuditLog model for comprehensive change tracking with attendance-specific metadata

**New Approval Workflow Interfaces**:
- AttendanceApprovalRequest: { recordId: string, editRequest: AttendanceEditRequest, submittedBy: string, submittedAt: Date }
- AttendanceApprovalDecision: { approvalId: string, decision: 'APPROVE' | 'REJECT', comments: string, decidedBy: string }
- AttendanceAuditEntry: extends AuditLog with attendance-specific fields for detailed change tracking

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: existing prisma/schema.prisma AttendanceRecord model]
**AttendanceRecord Table Enhancements**:
- New approval workflow fields: approval_required BOOLEAN, approval_status VARCHAR(20), approval_comments TEXT
- Enhanced audit fields: edit_reason TEXT, edit_category VARCHAR(10), threshold_triggered BOOLEAN
- Approval relationships: approved_by_id UUID REFERENCES users(id), approved_at TIMESTAMP
- Integration with existing AuditLog table for comprehensive change tracking with foreign key relationships

### Authentication and Role-Based Access
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#user and backend-architecture.md]
**Enhanced Role Validation Requirements**:
- All approval operations limited to ADMIN role following established patterns from Stories 5.1a-5.5a
- Approval queue access restricted to admin users with proper session validation
- Enhanced audit trail access controls with read-only access for management oversight
- Comprehensive approval action logging with user identification and accountability tracking

### Business Rules and Approval Thresholds
**Approval Trigger Logic**:
- Time change thresholds: Edits exceeding 2 hours require approval, minor adjustments (< 30 minutes) auto-approved
- Date modification rules: Any date changes require approval regardless of time duration
- Department-specific rules: Integration with Staff model for department-based approval requirements
- Override policies: Critical business situations allow immediate approval with enhanced audit trail documentation

### Audit Trail and Compliance Requirements
**Enhanced Audit Trail System**:
- Complete audit trail for all manual edits including approval workflow steps and decision rationale
- Before/after state tracking with detailed field-level change documentation using established AuditLog patterns
- Approval decision audit trail with timestamp, decision maker, and rationale documentation
- Integration with existing AttendanceRecord audit fields for comprehensive change history tracking
- Compliance-ready audit trail export functionality for regulatory requirements and management reporting

### Integration with Existing System
**Building on Previous Stories**:
- Direct integration with AttendanceEditModal from Story 5.5a for seamless approval workflow triggering
- Utilization of existing AttendanceRecord conflict resolution fields for approval status tracking
- Integration with established AttendanceListView and EmployeeAttendanceHistory for audit trail display
- Compatibility with existing authentication, authorization, and notification patterns from previous stories
- Foundation for upcoming attendance finalization workflow (Story 5.6) with approved edit tracking

- Hooks: camelCase with 'use' prefix (useAttendanceApproval, useAuditTrail)
- API Routes: kebab-case following established patterns
- Database Operations: Follow established Prisma transaction patterns for approval workflow
- Type Definitions: PascalCase following existing attendance type patterns

**Development Patterns**:
- Environment Variables: Access through config objects, never process.env directly
- Error Handling: All approval operations must use standard error handler patterns
- State Management: Use Zustand for approval workflow state and real-time audit trail updates
- API Patterns: Follow established Server Action patterns for approval and audit operations

### Project Structure Notes
Approval workflow system builds directly on the edit foundation from Story 5.5a with AttendanceEditModal ready for approval triggering integration. Component organization follows existing attendance module structure in src/components/business/attendance/. Database updates utilize existing conflict resolution fields and AuditLog model relationships. UI components extend existing shadcn/ui patterns with enhanced approval workflow forms and audit trail interfaces. Authentication and authorization follow established NextAuth.js admin role patterns. Testing follows established Jest + Testing Library + Supertest patterns. Integration prepares foundation for upcoming attendance finalization workflow (Story 5.6) with comprehensive approval tracking and audit trail system.
