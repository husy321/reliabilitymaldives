  - [x] Add user warning notifications before automatic logout occurs
- [x] Implement secure password hashing with bcrypt (AC: 3)
  - [x] Install and configure bcrypt for secure password hashing
  - [x] Create password hashing utility functions with proper salt rounds
  - [x] Implement password comparison functions for authentication
  - [x] Add password strength validation and security requirements
- [x] Configure secure session cookies and JWT settings (AC: 4)
  - [x] Configure NextAuth.js with secure cookie settings (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)

  - [x] Add CSRF protection and secure header configurations
- [x] Implement comprehensive logout functionality (AC: 5)
  - [x] Create logout API endpoint with proper session invalidation
  - [x] Implement client-side logout with session data cleanup
  - [x] Add logout from all devices functionality for security
  - [x] Test logout functionality across different browsers and scenarios

## Dev Notes

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Authentication: NextAuth.js v4+ for role-based auth system with built-in providers and session management
- Cache: Vercel KV (Redis) Latest for session and data caching with fast session storage
- Frontend Language: TypeScript 5.0+ for type-safe development

### Backend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- Authentication and Authorization: NextAuth.js integration with role-based middleware, session management, and comprehensive security features
- Service Architecture: Next.js API Routes with comprehensive error handling and security validation

### Frontend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- State Management Architecture: Global state using Zustand for application state, local useState for UI-specific state
- Component Organization: Session management components in auth/ directory

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
Users table with secure password storage:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role user_role NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Environment Variables: Access only through config objects, never process.env directly
- Error Handling: All API routes must use the standard error handler
- State Updates: Never mutate state directly - use proper state management patterns

### Security Requirements
- Password hashing: bcrypt with minimum 12 salt rounds
- Session timeout: 2 hours of inactivity
- Cookie security: httpOnly, secure, sameSite=strict
- JWT security: Proper signing, encryption, and expiration
- CSRF protection: Built-in NextAuth.js CSRF tokens

### File Locations
- Session utilities: `src/lib/session.ts` and `src/lib/auth.ts`
- Password utilities: `src/lib/password.ts`
- Authentication config: `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
- Session context: `src/contexts/SessionContext.tsx`
- Logout components: `src/components/auth/LogoutButton.tsx`
- Session management hooks: `src/hooks/useSession.ts`

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Backend Testing: Jest + Supertest for session management API testing
- Frontend Testing: Jest + Testing Library for session-related component testing
- Security testing for password hashing, session timeout, and logout functionality

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test file location: `src/__tests__/lib/session.test.ts`, `src/__tests__/lib/password.test.ts`, `src/__tests__/components/auth/`
- Test standards: Jest + Testing Library for React components, Jest + Supertest for API session management
- Testing frameworks: Jest 29+ and Testing Library 13+ with TypeScript support
- Specific requirements: Test session timeout, password hashing security, logout functionality, cookie security, and automatic session cleanup
