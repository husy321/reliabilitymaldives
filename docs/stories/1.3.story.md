## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 completion:
- NextAuth.js v4 authentication system fully implemented
- User session includes role information (ADMIN, SALES, ACCOUNTS, MANAGER, ACCOUNTANT)
- Session management with getServerSession for server components
- Route protection middleware already in place for dashboard access

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Frontend Framework: Next.js v14+ with App Router for server components
- UI Components: shadcn/ui v4 for consistent business UI components
- State Management: Zustand v4.4+ for client state management
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v3.3+ utility-first styling (included with shadcn/ui)
- Icons: Lucide React for navigation and UI icons
- Testing: Jest + Testing Library for component testing

### Frontend Architecture
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Component Organization: 
  - ui/ for shadcn/ui base components
  - business/ for business-specific components  
  - layouts/ for page layout components
- State Management: Zustand for global state, React Query for server state, useState for UI state
- Routing: Next.js App Router with route groups and middleware for role-based access

### Navigation and Layout Components
[Source: architecture/components.md#authentication-service]
- Authentication Service provides getSession() with role permissions
- Role-based access control using UserRole enum
- Session callbacks include user role in session for UI decisions

### User Data Model
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#user]
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  role: UserRole;
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

enum UserRole {
  ADMIN = 'ADMIN',
  SALES = 'SALES',
  ACCOUNTS = 'ACCOUNTS', 
  MANAGER = 'MANAGER',
  ACCOUNTANT = 'ACCOUNTANT'
}
```

### File Locations
Based on current project structure (flat Next.js, not monorepo):
- Dashboard page: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Navigation component: `src/components/layouts/navigation.tsx`
- Dashboard widgets: `src/components/business/dashboard/`
- User profile component: `src/components/layouts/user-profile.tsx`
- Notification components: `src/components/business/notifications/`
- Component tests: `src/components/__tests__/` subdirectories

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Components: PascalCase naming (e.g., `DashboardLayout.tsx`)
- Type Sharing: Define types in packages/shared (Note: current structure uses src/types/)
- Environment Variables: Access through config objects, never process.env directly
- State Updates: Never mutate state directly, use proper state management patterns

### Technical Constraints
- Must use NextAuth getServerSession for user data in server components
- Role-based menu filtering must use UserRole enum from authentication
- Mobile navigation must use shadcn/ui Sheet component for consistency
- All dashboard widgets must be wrapped in Card components
- Responsive design must use Tailwind CSS classes

### Project Structure Notes
Current project uses flat Next.js structure (src/app/) instead of documented monorepo structure (apps/web/). All file paths reflect actual project structure.

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Frontend Unit Testing: Jest + Testing Library for component testing
- Test files location: Create tests in `__tests__` subdirectory within component folders
- Component testing for dashboard layout, navigation, and widgets
- Mock NextAuth session data for testing role-based rendering
- Test responsive behavior using Testing Library screen size utilities
- Ensure proper TypeScript types in test files
