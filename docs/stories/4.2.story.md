## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 4.1 Sales Report Data Structure completion:
- SalesReport and Outlet data models are fully implemented with proper relationships
- Database schema includes unique constraints preventing duplicate date submissions per outlet
- Document linking system is ready through linkedToSalesReportId relationship
- PostgreSQL-compatible models with comprehensive validation and foreign key relationships
- Testing infrastructure established for data model validation and constraint testing

### Tech Stack Requirements  
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Frontend Framework: Next.js v14+ App Router for form routing and Server Components integration
- UI Components: shadcn/ui v4 for professional form components with excellent TypeScript support
- State Management: Zustand v4.4+ for form data state and UI state management during submission
- Form Validation: Zod for TypeScript-first form validation and error handling
- File Upload: Vercel Blob integration for document attachment functionality
- Frontend Testing: Jest + Testing Library v29+/13+ for component and form testing

### Component Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md and components.md]
**Form Component Location**: `src/components/forms/` directory for business form components
**Component Organization**: Use business-specific components pattern for SalesReportForm
**State Management**: React Query for server state, Zustand for client state, useState for UI-specific state
**Server Actions Integration**: Next.js native Server Actions for form processing and data submission

### Sales Report Workflow Service Integration
[Source: architecture/components.md#sales-report-workflow-service]
**Key Interface to Implement**: 
- `submitReport(outletId, date, salesData)` - Manager report submission with duplicate prevention
**Dependencies**: Document Management Service (supporting files), Authentication Service (role verification)
**Technology Stack**: Server Actions for form processing, shadcn/ui for form interface components

### Data Model Integration
[Source: architecture/data-models.md and previous story implementation]
**SalesReport Model Usage**:
```typescript
interface SalesReport {
  id: string;
  outletId: string;
  date: Date;
  cashDeposits: number;
  cardSettlements: number;
  totalSales: number;      // Calculated field (cash + card)
  submittedById: string;   // Current user ID
  status: SalesReportStatus; // Default to DRAFT
  // ... other fields from model
}
```

**Outlet Model Usage**:
```typescript
interface Outlet {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  location: string;
  managerId: string;       // Must match current user for permission validation
  // ... other fields from model
}
```

### Document Management Integration
[Source: architecture/components.md#document-management-service]
**Required Integration**:
- `uploadFiles(files, metadata)` - Process sales receipt uploads with validation
- `linkDocumentToEntity(docId, reportId, 'SALES_REPORT')` - Connect receipts to sales reports
- Document category should be set to `SALES_RECEIPT` for uploaded supporting documents
- Use existing drag-and-drop functionality from document service

### Form Validation Requirements
[Source: architecture/data-models.md and database-schema.md]
**Required Validations**:
- Date validation: Must be current or past date, no future dates allowed
- Outlet validation: User must be manager of selected outlet (managerId === user.id)
- Amount validation: Cash deposits and card settlements must be non-negative numbers
- Duplicate prevention: Cannot submit report for same outlet and date combination
- File validation: Uploaded documents must be valid image/PDF formats for receipts

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Form Component: `src/components/forms/SalesReportForm.tsx` (new file)
- Server Action: `app/actions/sales-report-actions.ts` (new file)
- Route Page: `app/dashboard/sales-reports/new/page.tsx` (new file)
- Type Definitions: Use existing `types/sales-report.ts` and `types/outlet.ts` from Story 4.1
- Test Files: `src/__tests__/components/SalesReportForm.test.tsx` (new file)

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Component Naming**: Use PascalCase for `SalesReportForm.tsx`
- **API Routes**: Use kebab-case for `/dashboard/sales-reports/new` route
- **Type Sharing**: Import types from existing types directory for consistent interfaces
- **Error Handling**: All form submissions must use standard error handling patterns
- **State Updates**: Use proper state management patterns, never mutate state directly

### Authentication and Role-Based Access
[Source: architecture/components.md#authentication-service]
**Required Role Validation**:
- Route must be protected with `requireRole('MANAGER')` middleware
- User session must contain role permissions for outlet management
- Outlet selection must validate user has manager permissions for chosen outlet
- Form submission must include user ID for `submittedById` field

### Project Structure Notes
Form component integrates with existing Next.js App Router structure. Server Actions follow established patterns for form processing. Document attachment leverages existing Vercel Blob integration. Route protection uses established NextAuth.js middleware patterns. Component testing follows existing Jest + Testing Library patterns established in previous stories.

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Frontend Unit Testing**: Jest + Testing Library v29+/13+ for form component validation and user interactions
- **Test Locations**:
  - `src/__tests__/components/SalesReportForm.test.tsx` - Form component validation, user interactions, and submission flows
- **Testing Scenarios**:
  - Form field validation (date, amounts, outlet selection)
  - Automatic total calculation with various input combinations
  - Document upload integration and file validation
  - Form submission success and error handling
  - Outlet permission validation and auto-selection
  - Role-based access control and route protection
  - Server action integration and response handling
  - Duplicate submission prevention and user feedback
