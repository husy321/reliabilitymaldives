## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3 completion:
- NextAuth.js v4 authentication system fully implemented
- UserRole enum already defined: ADMIN, SALES, ACCOUNTS, MANAGER, ACCOUNTANT
- Session management requires user role information from database
- Route protection middleware needs database user validation

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Database: PostgreSQL v15+ for ACID compliance and financial data integrity
- ORM: Prisma ORM v5+ for type-safe database operations and migrations
- Backend Language: TypeScript v5.0+ for unified language stack across project
- Testing: Jest v29+ for comprehensive database model and migration testing

### Database Schema Architecture
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- UUID primary keys using uuid_generate_v4() for all tables
- PostgreSQL enums for user_role, document_category, receivable_status
- Performance indexes for business-critical queries
- File size constraints and validation rules for security

Core schema structure:
```sql
-- Enable UUID extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";

-- User roles enum matching authentication
CREATE TYPE user_role AS ENUM ('ADMIN', 'SALES', 'ACCOUNTS', 'MANAGER', 'ACCOUNTANT');

-- Users table with authentication
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role user_role NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#user]
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  role: UserRole;
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

enum UserRole {
  ADMIN = 'ADMIN',
  SALES = 'SALES',
  ACCOUNTS = 'ACCOUNTS', 
  MANAGER = 'MANAGER',
  ACCOUNTANT = 'ACCOUNTANT'
}
```

### Backend Architecture
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- Prisma ORM with repository pattern for data access abstraction
- Type-safe database operations with comprehensive error handling
- Database architecture supporting NextAuth.js integration requirements

### File Locations
Based on current flat Next.js project structure:
- Prisma schema: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Database migrations: `prisma/migrations/`
- Seed script: `prisma/seed.ts`  
- Model tests: `src/__tests__/models/` (following project test structure)
- Database utilities: `src/lib/database/` (if needed for advanced operations)

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Database Tables: snake_case naming convention (users, audit_logs)
- Type Sharing: Define types in shared location, imported consistently
- Environment Variables: Database connection through config objects only
- Never mutate state directly: Use Prisma's type-safe operations

### Technical Constraints
- Must use PostgreSQL v15+ with UUID extension for primary keys
- UserRole enum must exactly match authentication system enum
- All tables require created_at and updated_at timestamps
- Foreign key relationships must maintain referential integrity
- Audit logging must capture all critical system changes
- Seed data must be idempotent for multiple executions

### Project Structure Notes
Current project uses flat Next.js structure with Prisma at root level (`prisma/`) instead of documented monorepo structure (`apps/web/prisma/`). All file paths reflect actual project structure.

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Backend Unit Testing: Jest v29+ for database model and migration testing
- Test files location: Create tests in `src/__tests__/models/` following current structure
- Database testing with in-memory or test database isolation
- Mock Prisma client for unit test isolation where appropriate
- Integration tests for migration execution and rollback procedures
- Ensure proper TypeScript types in all test files

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-02

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

**Quality Assessment Summary:**
Story 1.4 demonstrates excellent architectural planning and implementation with comprehensive unit tests, documentation, and adherence to coding standards. The database schema design properly implements UUID primary keys, foreign key relationships, and follows PostgreSQL best practices. However, a critical blocker prevents full completion.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Comprehensive unit test coverage for all models
- ✅ Proper PostgreSQL schema design with UUID support  
- ✅ Excellent documentation including backup strategies
- ✅ Strong alignment with technical architecture requirements
- ✅ Idempotent seed script with role definitions

**Critical Issues:**
- ❌ Migration execution blocked by PostgreSQL server dependency
- ⚠️ Cannot verify database schema creation in real environment

**Recommendations:**
1. Set up PostgreSQL development server to complete migrations
2. Execute and test migration rollback functionality 
3. Verify database indexes and constraints are properly created
4. Run integration tests against actual database once available
