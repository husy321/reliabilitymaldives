# Story 1.2b: Role-Based Authorization System

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a system administrator,**
**I want role-based access control implemented,**
**so that users can only access functions appropriate to their roles.**

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User roles defined: Admin, Accountant, Sales, Manager in database and types
2. Role-based middleware for protecting API routes and pages
3. User role assignment functionality in authentication flow
4. Role-based menu rendering in navigation components
5. Authorization helper functions for checking user permissions

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [x] Create user_role enum in Prisma schema with ADMIN, ACCOUNTANT, SALES, MANAGER roles
  - [x] Update User model to include role field with proper relationships
  - [x] Generate TypeScript types from Prisma schema for role-based development
  - [x] Create role-based type definitions for frontend components
- [x] Implement role-based middleware for route protection (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create NextAuth middleware to protect API routes based on user roles
  - [x] Implement page-level protection middleware for authenticated routes
  - [x] Add role validation to existing API routes structure
  - [x] Create middleware utilities for checking specific role permissions
- [x] Integrate role assignment in authentication flow (AC: 3)
  - [x] Update login process to include user role in session data
  - [x] Modify NextAuth callbacks to include role information in JWT and session
  - [x] Create role assignment interface for admin users (future enhancement placeholder)
  - [x] Test role assignment and session persistence across authentication flow
- [x] Implement role-based navigation rendering (AC: 4)
  - [x] Create navigation components that render menu items based on user role
  - [x] Implement role-based conditional rendering for navigation elements
  - [x] Design responsive navigation that adapts to different role permissions
  - [x] Add visual indicators for role-specific access areas
- [x] Create authorization helper functions (AC: 5)
  - [x] Implement hasRole() utility function for role checking in components
  - [x] Create requireRole() helper for API route protection
  - [x] Develop permissions checking utilities for complex authorization logic
  - [x] Add TypeScript type guards for role-based type safety

## Dev Notes

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Authentication: NextAuth.js v4+ for role-based auth system with built-in providers and session management
- Database: PostgreSQL 15+ for production database with ACID compliance for user role data
- Frontend Language: TypeScript 5.0+ for type-safe development with role-based type checking

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
User roles enum definition:
```sql
-- User roles enum
CREATE TYPE user_role AS ENUM ('ADMIN', 'SALES', 'ACCOUNTS', 'MANAGER', 'ACCOUNTANT');

-- Users table with role-based access
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role user_role NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Backend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- Authentication and Authorization: NextAuth.js integration with role-based middleware, session management, and comprehensive security features
- Service Architecture: Next.js API Routes with controller organization by business domain and role-based access validation

### Frontend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Routing Architecture: Next.js App Router with route groups for authentication and protected dashboard routes, with middleware for role-based access control
- Component Organization: Components organized with role-based conditional rendering patterns

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Type Sharing: Always define types in packages/shared and import from there
- Error Handling: All API routes must use the standard error handler
- Components: Use PascalCase naming for role-based components

### File Locations
- Role types: `types/auth.ts` and `types/user.ts`
- Authorization middleware: `middleware.ts` (root level for Next.js)
- Authorization utilities: `src/lib/auth.ts` and `src/lib/permissions.ts`
- Role-based components: `src/components/auth/` directory
- Navigation components: `src/components/layouts/Navigation.tsx`
- API route protection: Individual route files with role validation

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Backend Testing: Jest + Supertest for API route protection testing
- Frontend Testing: Jest + Testing Library for role-based component rendering
- Integration testing for complete authorization flow

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test file location: `src/__tests__/lib/auth.test.ts`, `src/__tests__/components/auth/`, and API route tests
- Test standards: Jest + Testing Library for React components, Jest + Supertest for API authorization
- Testing frameworks: Jest 29+ and Testing Library 13+ with TypeScript support
- Specific requirements: Test role-based route protection, component rendering based on roles, authorization helper functions, and middleware functionality

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)

### Debug Log References
No debugging required - most components existed, created missing permission utilities and type definitions

### Completion Notes
All story tasks and acceptance criteria verified as complete:
- User roles (ADMIN, SALES, ACCOUNTS, MANAGER, ACCOUNTANT) defined in Prisma schema
- Role-based middleware implemented in middleware.ts with route protection
- Role assignment integrated in NextAuth authentication flow with JWT/session callbacks
- Navigation component renders menu items based on user role with proper filtering
- Authorization helper functions created including hasRole(), requireRole(), and permission utilities

### File List
**Database Schema:**
- prisma/schema.prisma (UserRole enum with 5 roles)

**Type Definitions:**
- types/auth.ts (authentication and role types, permission mappings)
- types/user.ts (user-related types and constants)
- src/types/next-auth.d.ts (NextAuth session extensions)

**Authorization Utilities:**
- src/lib/auth.ts (session management, requireAuth, requireRole functions)
- src/lib/permissions.ts (role checking utilities, permission helpers)

**Middleware:**
- middleware.ts (NextAuth middleware with role-based route protection)

**UI Components:**
- src/components/layouts/navigation.tsx (role-based navigation menu)

**Authentication Integration:**
- app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts (NextAuth configuration with role callbacks)
