- Frontend Testing: Jest + Testing Library 29+/13+ for component and unit testing
- Backend Testing: Jest + Supertest 29+/6+ for API and integration testing

### Data Model Requirements
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
**Staff Data Model Extension**:
- Integration with existing User model for authentication and role management
- Staff-specific fields beyond User model: employee ID, department, shift schedule
- Relationship with User model for login credentials and role-based access
- Support for attendance system integration (employee ID mapping from previous stories)

**Staff Table Schema Requirements**:
- id: string (UUID) - Unique staff identifier for database relationships
- employeeId: string - Business employee ID for ZKT machine integration and payroll
- name: string - Full employee name for display and reporting
- department: string - Department assignment for organizational structure
- shiftSchedule: string - Work shift information for attendance validation
- isActive: boolean - Employment status for filtering and access control
- userId: string - Foreign key to User table for authentication linkage
- createdAt: Date - Record creation timestamp for audit trails
- updatedAt: Date - Last modification timestamp for change tracking

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
**Staff Table Creation**:
- UUID primary key with PostgreSQL uuid_generate_v4() function
- Unique constraint on employeeId for business rule enforcement
- Foreign key relationship to users table for authentication integration
- Database indexes for performance: staff search (name, employeeId), department filtering
- Check constraints for data validation: employeeId format, department enum values

### Backend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
**Service Organization**: 
- Create dedicated Staff service following established repository pattern
- Integrate with existing authentication middleware for role-based access
- Server Actions for staff management operations following established API patterns
- Comprehensive error handling using standard error handler with structured logging

### Frontend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
**Component Organization**:
- Staff components in `src/components/business/staff/` following component architecture
- Form components using Server Actions following established form patterns
- Integration with global state management using Zustand for staff UI state
- Route protection using NextAuth.js middleware for admin-only access

### Component Requirements
[Source: architecture/components.md]
**Staff Management Components**:
- Staff CRUD operations following established business component patterns
- Integration with Authentication Service for role-based access validation
- Form processing using Server Actions following established patterns
- Search and filtering capabilities with pagination following established UI patterns

### Authentication and Role-Based Access
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#user and backend-architecture.md]
**Role Validation Requirements**:
- All staff management operations limited to ADMIN role
- Role-based middleware validation for all staff management endpoints
- Session management integration following established NextAuth.js patterns
- Staff-User relationship for login credentials and permission inheritance

### Search and Filtering Requirements
**Staff Search Capabilities**:
- Real-time search by employee name using PostgreSQL full-text search
- Employee ID exact match search for quick employee lookup
- Department filtering with multi-select options
- Active/inactive status filtering for current employee management
- Advanced search combining multiple criteria with AND/OR logic
- Search result pagination with configurable page sizes
- Sort functionality by name, department, join date, and employee ID

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
**Naming Conventions**:
- Components: PascalCase (StaffList, StaffForm, StaffCard)
- Hooks: camelCase with 'use' prefix (useStaffSearch, useStaffForm)
- API Routes: kebab-case following established patterns
- Database Tables: snake_case (staff table, staff_departments)
- Type Definitions: PascalCase following type sharing patterns

**Development Patterns**:
- Environment Variables: Access through config objects, never process.env directly
- Error Handling: All staff operations must use standard error handler
- State Management: Use Zustand for staff form data and search state
- API Patterns: Follow established Server Action patterns for staff operations

### Project Structure Notes
Staff management system integrates seamlessly with existing architecture patterns. Database schema extends current User model relationship patterns. UI components follow established shadcn/ui component organization. Authentication and authorization use existing NextAuth.js role-based access patterns. Testing follows established Jest + Testing Library + Supertest patterns from previous stories.
