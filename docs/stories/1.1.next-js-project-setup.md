## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the first story in the epic.

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Frontend Framework: Next.js v14+ with App Router, Server Components, and Server Actions
- Frontend Language: TypeScript 5.0+ for type-safe development
- UI Component Library: shadcn/ui v4 for professional business UI with TypeScript support
- CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS 3.3+ (included with shadcn/ui)
- Build Tool: Next.js v14+ integrated build system with Turbopack for development

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Main application location: `apps/web/` (if using monorepo structure)
- Next.js App Router: `app/` directory for routing
- Source code: `src/` directory for application source
- Static assets: `public/` directory
- Configuration files at root level

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Component organization structure:
  ```
  src/components/
  ├── ui/                      # shadcn/ui base components
  ├── business/                # Business-specific components  
  ├── forms/                   # Form components using Server Actions
  └── layouts/                 # Page layout components
  ```

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Components: PascalCase naming (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`)
- Always use TypeScript with proper type definitions
- Environment variables: Access through config objects, never process.env directly
- State Updates: Never mutate state directly, use proper state management patterns

### File Locations
- Main application: Follow unified project structure in apps/web/ or root
- Components: src/components/ with proper subdirectory organization
- Layout files: src/components/layouts/
- Type definitions: types/ directory for shared types
- Configuration: Root level for Next.js config files

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Frontend Unit Testing: Jest + Testing Library for component testing
- Test files location: tests/ directory or co-located with components
- Testing pyramid approach with comprehensive unit test coverage
- Component testing for layout and UI components

### Technical Constraints
- Next.js v14+ required for latest App Router features
- TypeScript 5.0+ for modern type system features  
- shadcn/ui v4 for consistent UI component system
- Tailwind CSS 3.3+ for utility-first styling approach

## Testing
- Unit tests for layout component using Jest + Testing Library
- Component rendering tests to verify shadcn/ui integration
- TypeScript compilation tests to ensure proper configuration
- Development server startup and hot reload functionality tests
