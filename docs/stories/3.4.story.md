## Dev Notes

### Data Model Requirements
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
Follow-up model extending User relationships:
```typescript
interface FollowUp {
  id: string;
  customerId: string;
  receivableId: string | null;
  userId: string; // Created by
  followUpDate: Date;
  followUpType: FollowUpType;
  notes: string;
  status: FollowUpStatus;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;

  // Relationships
  customer: Customer;
  receivable?: Receivable;
  createdBy: User;
}

enum FollowUpType {
  PHONE_CALL = 'PHONE_CALL',
  EMAIL = 'EMAIL',
  MEETING = 'MEETING',
  PAYMENT_REMINDER = 'PAYMENT_REMINDER',
  OTHER = 'OTHER'
}

enum FollowUpStatus {
  SCHEDULED = 'SCHEDULED',
  COMPLETED = 'COMPLETED',
  CANCELLED = 'CANCELLED'
}
```

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- UI Component Library: shadcn/ui v4 for professional business UI with Form, Tabs, Select, and Calendar components
- Database: PostgreSQL 15+ for production database with proper relationships
- Frontend Language: TypeScript 5.0+ for type-safe development

### Frontend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Component Organization: Business-specific components in src/components/business/receivables/
- State Management: Zustand for follow-up state management and React Query for server state
- Form Components: Server Actions integration for follow-up form processing

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
```sql
CREATE TYPE follow_up_type AS ENUM ('PHONE_CALL', 'EMAIL', 'MEETING', 'PAYMENT_REMINDER', 'OTHER');
CREATE TYPE follow_up_status AS ENUM ('SCHEDULED', 'COMPLETED', 'CANCELLED');

CREATE TABLE follow_ups (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    customer_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES customers(id),
    receivable_id UUID REFERENCES receivables(id),
    created_by_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    follow_up_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    follow_up_type follow_up_type NOT NULL,
    notes TEXT NOT NULL,
    status follow_up_status DEFAULT 'SCHEDULED',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_follow_ups_customer_date ON follow_ups(customer_id, follow_up_date DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_follow_ups_receivable ON follow_ups(receivable_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_follow_ups_type_status ON follow_ups(follow_up_type, status);
```

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Components: Use PascalCase naming (FollowUpTab.tsx, FollowUpForm.tsx)
- API Routes: Use kebab-case for follow-up endpoints (/api/follow-ups)
- Database Tables: Use snake_case (follow_ups table)

### File Locations
- Follow-up components: `src/components/business/receivables/FollowUpTab.tsx`
- Follow-up form: `src/components/business/receivables/FollowUpForm.tsx`
- Follow-up history: `src/components/business/receivables/FollowUpHistory.tsx`
- Follow-up API: `app/api/follow-ups/route.ts`
- Follow-up types: `types/followUp.ts`
- Follow-up service: `src/services/followUpService.ts`

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Frontend Testing: Jest + Testing Library for follow-up component interactions
- Backend Testing: Jest + Supertest for follow-up API endpoints
- Integration testing for complete follow-up workflow

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test file location: `src/__tests__/components/business/receivables/FollowUpTab.test.tsx`
- Test standards: Jest + Testing Library for React components, Jest + Supertest for API testing
- Testing frameworks: Jest 29+ and Testing Library 13+ with TypeScript support
- Specific requirements: Test follow-up creation, history display, tab navigation, form validation, and chronological ordering
