## Dev Notes

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Frontend Language: TypeScript 5.0+ for type-safe development
- Frontend Framework: Next.js 14+ with App Router for fullstack React framework
- UI Component Library: shadcn/ui v4 for professional business UI with excellent TypeScript support
- CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS 3.3+ for utility-first styling, included with shadcn/ui

```

### Frontend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Component Organization: Components organized in src/components/ with ui/ for shadcn base components
- State Management: Zustand 4.4+ for client state management (to be integrated later)
- Routing Architecture: Next.js App Router with route groups for authentication and protected routes

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Type Sharing: Define types in packages/shared and import from there
- Components: Use PascalCase naming (e.g., UserProfile.tsx)
- Environment Variables: Access only through config objects, never process.env directly

### File Locations
- Layout components: `src/components/layouts/`
- shadcn/ui components: `src/components/ui/` (auto-generated by shadcn CLI)
- Type definitions: `types/` (root level for project-wide types)
- Configuration: `lib/utils.ts` (shadcn utility functions)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Frontend Testing: Jest + Testing Library 29+/13+ for component and unit testing
- Test files should be co-located with components or in `__tests__` directories
- Comprehensive testing approach for component rendering and functionality

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test file location: Co-located with components or in `__tests__` directories
- Test standards: Jest + Testing Library for React component testing
- Testing frameworks: Jest 29+ and Testing Library 13+ with TypeScript support
- Specific requirements: Test component rendering, props handling, and basic interactions
