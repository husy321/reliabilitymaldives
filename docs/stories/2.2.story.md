## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.1a completion:
- Server Action `uploadDocumentAction` implemented in `src/lib/actions/documents.ts`
- Document model and validation established with proper TypeScript types
- File storage system operational with category-based organization
- Multiple file upload support already built into backend

From Story 2.1b context:
- File validation logic will be available for frontend validation
- Security measures in place for file type and size validation
- Enhanced metadata storage for comprehensive file tracking

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Frontend Language: TypeScript v5.0+ for type-safe development
- Frontend Framework: Next.js v14+ with App Router for component structure
- UI Component Library: shadcn/ui v4 for professional business UI components
- State Management: Zustand v4.4+ for client state management of upload progress
- CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS v3.3+ for utility-first styling (included with shadcn/ui)
- Frontend Testing: Jest v29+ + Testing Library v13+ for component testing

### Component Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]
Component organization structure:
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/                      # shadcn/ui base components (Button, Card, Progress)
│   ├── business/                # Business-specific components (DocumentUploader)
│   ├── forms/                   # Form components using Server Actions
│   └── layouts/                 # Page layout components
```

### Document Management Service Integration
[Source: architecture/components.md#document-management-service]
Key interfaces to integrate with:
- `uploadFiles(files, metadata)` - Process multiple file uploads with validation
- `categorizeDocument(filename)` - Automatic pattern recognition integration
- Technology Stack: React Dropzone for frontend drag-and-drop functionality

### State Management Architecture
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]
- Global state using Zustand for upload progress and queue management
- Local useState for UI-specific state (drag states, file selection)
- React Query for server state management (not needed for this story)

### Upload Workflow Integration
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#document-upload-and-categorization-workflow]
Frontend component integration points:
1. User drags and drops files → UI components
2. UI calls Server Action `uploadDocumentAction(formData)`
3. Progress tracking and visual feedback during upload process
4. Category confirmation dialog integration for pattern recognition
5. Success notification and file management interface
6. Target time: <30 seconds total upload time

### API Integration Specifications
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md#nextjs-server-actions-primary]
Server Action integration pattern:
```typescript
// Integration with existing uploadDocumentAction
const handleFileUpload = async (files: File[]) => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  files.forEach(file => formData.append('files', file));
  formData.append('category', selectedCategory);
  
  const result = await uploadDocumentAction(formData);
  if (result.success) {
    // Handle success with progress completion
  } else {
    // Handle error with user feedback
  }
}
```

### File Locations
Based on current flat Next.js project structure:
- Main upload component: `src/components/business/DocumentUploader.tsx`
- UI components: Use existing `src/components/ui/` shadcn/ui components
- State management: `src/hooks/useUploadProgress.ts` (new custom hook)
- Types: `types/upload.ts` (new types for upload progress and states)
- Tests: `src/__tests__/components/business/DocumentUploader.test.tsx`

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Type Sharing**: Define upload-related types in shared `types/` directory
- **State Updates**: Use proper state management patterns with Zustand for upload queue
- **Naming Conventions**: Components use PascalCase (`DocumentUploader.tsx`)
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error boundaries and user feedback
- **Environment Variables**: Access through config objects if needed

### Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with existing Server Action `uploadDocumentAction`
- File validation must align with backend validation (10MB limit, approved formats)
- Upload progress tracking requires XMLHttpRequest for progress events (not fetch)
- Component must handle both drag-drop and traditional file input methods
- Performance target: 30-second maximum upload time with progress monitoring
- Must provide accessible interface for users with disabilities

### Security Considerations
- Client-side file validation as first-line defense (backend validation is authoritative)
- Prevent malicious file uploads through UI restrictions
- Ensure secure file handling during drag-drop operations
- No sensitive data exposure in progress tracking or error messages

### Project Structure Notes
Current project uses flat Next.js structure. Component will be placed in `src/components/business/` following the established pattern. No conflicts with existing structure identified.

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Frontend Unit Testing: Jest v29+ + Testing Library v13+ for component testing
- Component testing focusing on drag-drop interactions, file handling, and progress tracking
- Test files location: `src/__tests__/components/business/`
- Mock Server Actions and file upload responses for isolation
- Test accessibility features and keyboard navigation
- Performance testing for upload time requirements and progress accuracy
- Ensure proper TypeScript types in all test files

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-03

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

**Summary:** Drag-and-drop upload interface successfully implemented with all acceptance criteria met. Core functionality is solid with minor architectural concerns for production readiness.

**Key Strengths:**
- Complete drag-and-drop functionality with visual feedback and multiple file support
- Comprehensive upload progress tracking with individual file status indicators
- Performance optimizations including 30-second timeout and concurrent upload limiting
- Well-structured component architecture using shadcn/ui with proper TypeScript typing
- Thorough test coverage for component interactions and upload scenarios

**Areas for Attention:**
- Custom API route pattern deviates from established Server Action approach - needs architectural validation
- Authentication integration requires runtime validation in production environment
- Consider consolidating upload patterns for consistency across the application

**Technical Quality:**
- Clean separation of concerns with Zustand store and custom hooks
- Proper error handling and user feedback throughout upload process
- Toast notifications and accessibility considerations implemented
