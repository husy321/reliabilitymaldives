### PDF Generation Service Requirements
[Source: architecture/components.md#pdf-generation-service]
**Payroll Export Operations**:
- Key operation: `generatePayrollReport(periodId, employees)` - Payroll summary with attendance details
- `applyCompanyBranding(pdfBuffer)` - Consistent company letterhead and formatting for professional documents
- Dependencies: HR Service (payroll data), PayrollCalculationService (calculation results), company branding assets
- Technology Stack: react-pdf for client-side generation or Puppeteer for server-side PDF creation with company templates

### Frontend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
**Component Organization**:
- Export components organized in existing src/components/business/payroll/ directory as extension of payroll domain
- Integration with existing PayrollPeriodHistory component for export status and download capabilities
- New export interface using shadcn/ui Dialog, Form, and Progress components for export workflow
- Enhanced Accounts team dashboard integration with export capabilities and status tracking
- State management using Zustand for export workflow state and progress tracking with real-time updates

### Data Model Requirements
**PayrollExport Model** (New):
- id: string - Unique export identifier for tracking and audit purposes
- payrollPeriodId: string - Link to PayrollPeriod from Story 5.7a for data source
- exportedBy: string - User who performed export for accountability and audit trail
- exportedAt: Date - Export timestamp for record keeping and audit compliance
- exportFormat: 'PDF' - Export format type (extensible for future formats)
- fileName: string - Generated file name for download and storage reference
- filePath: string - Storage path for generated export file
- fileSize: number - File size in bytes for storage management and validation
- status: 'GENERATING' | 'COMPLETED' | 'FAILED' - Export process status tracking
- metadata: JSON - Export parameters and generation details for audit and troubleshooting

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: existing prisma/schema.prisma patterns]
**New PayrollExport Table**:
- id UUID PRIMARY KEY - Unique export identifier
- payroll_period_id UUID REFERENCES payroll_periods(id) - Link to payroll calculation data
- exported_by_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) - User accountability for export actions
- exported_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW() - Export generation timestamp
- export_format VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'PDF' - Export format specification
- file_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL - Generated file name for downloads
- file_path VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL - Storage location for generated files
- file_size INTEGER DEFAULT 0 - File size tracking
- status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'GENERATING' - Export process status
- metadata JSONB - Export configuration and parameters
- created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW() - Record creation tracking

### Authentication and Role-Based Access
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#user and backend-architecture.md]
**Export Access Control Requirements**:
- Payroll export operations limited to ACCOUNTS role following established payroll patterns
- ADMIN role access for export oversight and audit trail review
- Export generation audit logging with user identification and export accountability
- Integration with existing NextAuth.js role-based middleware for export route protection

### Notification Service Integration
[Source: architecture/components.md#notification-service]
**Export Notification Requirements**:
- Integration with existing broadcastToRole('ACCOUNTS', message) for export completion notifications
- Export completion notifications with download links and file information
- Export failure notifications with error details and retry options
- Notification history tracking for export workflow compliance and audit requirements

### Business Rules and Export Logic
**Payroll Export Requirements**:
- Export functionality only available for APPROVED payroll periods from Story 5.7a workflow
- PDF generation includes company branding, period summary, and detailed employee breakdown
- Export audit trail maintains generation details, user accountability, and file metadata
- Export file naming convention: 'Payroll_Export_Period_{startDate}_{endDate}_{timestamp}.pdf'
- Export status tracking prevents duplicate exports and provides download capabilities
- Generated files stored securely with access control and audit logging

### Integration with Existing System
**Building on Previous Stories**:
- Direct integration with PayrollPeriod and PayrollRecord models from Story 5.7a
- Utilization of existing payroll calculation data from PayrollCalculationService
- Integration with established PayrollPeriodHistory component for export status display
- Compatibility with existing authentication, authorization, and file storage patterns
- Foundation completes the HR-to-Payroll workflow from attendance tracking to external system integration

- API Routes: kebab-case following established patterns (payroll/export/generate, payroll/export/history)
- Database Operations: Follow established Prisma transaction patterns for export audit trail persistence
- Type Definitions: PascalCase following existing payroll domain type patterns

**Development Patterns**:
- Environment Variables: Access through config objects, never process.env directly
- Error Handling: All export operations must use standard error handler patterns
- State Management: Use Zustand for export workflow state and progress tracking
- API Patterns: Follow established Server Action patterns for export generation and file operations

### Project Structure Notes
Payroll export system extends the comprehensive payroll calculation foundation from Story 5.7a with PayrollPeriod and PayrollRecord data ready for export processing. Component organization continues in existing business/payroll directory following established patterns. Database design introduces PayrollExport model with relationships to existing PayrollPeriod table and audit trail capabilities. UI components utilize existing shadcn/ui patterns with enhanced export forms and PDF preview functionality. Authentication and authorization follow established NextAuth.js role patterns with ACCOUNTS team access. File storage integrates with Vercel Blob or local storage patterns for generated PDF files. PDF generation utilizes established PDF Generation Service patterns from architecture components specification. Notification integration uses existing Notification Service patterns for export workflow alerts. Testing follows established Jest + Testing Library + Supertest patterns. Integration completes the HR-to-Payroll workflow enabling external accounting system integration with professional payroll export documents.
