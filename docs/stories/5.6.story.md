### HR Attendance Service Requirements
[Source: architecture/components.md#hr-attendance-service]
**Finalization Workflow Operations**:
- `finalizeAttendanceForPayroll(periodId)` - Lock attendance data for payroll processing with comprehensive validation
- New operations: `validatePeriodForFinalization(periodId)` - Ensure all approvals complete and data integrity
- `lockAttendancePeriod(periodId, userId)` - Apply database-level locks preventing further edits
- `unlockAttendancePeriod(periodId, userId, reason)` - Emergency unlock functionality with audit trail
- `getFinalizationStatus(periodId)` - Period status queries for dashboard and interface display
- Dependencies: AttendanceRecord model (from Stories 5.1a-5.5b), AuditLog model, User model, Notification Service
- Technology Stack: Prisma transactions for period finalization, Next.js Server Actions, shadcn/ui period management forms

### Frontend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
**Component Organization**:
- Finalization components organized in src/components/business/attendance/ extending existing structure
- Integration with existing AttendanceListView and EmployeeAttendanceHistory for period status display
- New period management interface using shadcn/ui Calendar and Dialog components for date selection
- Enhanced admin dashboard integration with finalization status tracking and controls
- State management using Zustand for finalization workflow state and real-time period status updates

### Data Model Requirements
**AttendancePeriod Model** (New):
- id: string - Unique period identifier for finalization tracking
- startDate: Date - Period start date for payroll processing boundaries
- endDate: Date - Period end date for attendance data inclusion
- status: 'PENDING' | 'FINALIZED' | 'LOCKED' - Current finalization status
- finalizedBy: string - User who performed finalization for accountability
- finalizedAt: Date - Finalization timestamp for audit trail
- unlockReason: string - Emergency unlock justification for audit compliance

**AttendanceRecord Finalization Extensions**:
- periodId: string - Link to AttendancePeriod for finalization workflow
- isFinalized: boolean - Quick lookup for period finalization status
- Integration with existing approval status fields from Story 5.5b

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: existing prisma/schema.prisma]
**New AttendancePeriod Table**:
- id UUID PRIMARY KEY - Unique period identifier
- start_date DATE NOT NULL - Period start boundary
- end_date DATE NOT NULL - Period end boundary
- status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'PENDING' - Finalization status
- finalized_by_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) - User accountability
- finalized_at TIMESTAMP - Finalization timestamp
- unlock_reason TEXT - Emergency unlock justification
- created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW() - Period creation tracking

**AttendanceRecord Table Enhancements**:
- period_id UUID REFERENCES attendance_periods(id) - Period relationship
- is_finalized BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE - Quick finalization lookup
- Integration with existing approval workflow fields from Story 5.5b

### Authentication and Role-Based Access
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#user and backend-architecture.md]
**Enhanced Role Validation Requirements**:
- Finalization operations limited to ADMIN role following established patterns
- Period unlock functionality restricted to ADMIN with enhanced audit trail
- Accounts team notification access for finalized period information
- Comprehensive finalization action logging with user identification and accountability

### Notification Service Integration
[Source: architecture/components.md#notification-service]
**Finalization Notification Requirements**:
- Integration with existing broadcastToRole('ACCOUNTS', message) for team alerts
- Finalization event notifications with period details and employee summary
- Real-time finalization status updates using established SSE patterns
- Notification history tracking for compliance and audit requirements

### Business Rules and Finalization Logic
**Finalization Requirements**:
- All attendance edits must be approved before period can be finalized
- Period finalization creates database-level locks preventing further modifications
- Emergency unlock requires admin privileges and detailed justification
- Finalized periods generate automatic notifications to Accounts team
- Period status tracking supports multiple concurrent periods in different states

### Integration with Existing System
**Building on Previous Stories**:
- Direct integration with AttendanceRecord approval status from Story 5.5b
- Utilization of existing AuditLog model for finalization audit trail
- Integration with established AttendanceListView and EmployeeAttendanceHistory components
- Compatibility with existing authentication, authorization, and notification patterns
- Foundation for upcoming payroll calculation workflow (Story 5.7a) with finalized period data

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Finalization Components: `src/components/business/attendance/` (extend existing)
  - `AttendanceFinalizationModal.tsx` - Period finalization interface with validation
  - `AttendancePeriodStatus.tsx` - Period status display and management
  - `AttendancePeriodHistory.tsx` - Finalization timeline and audit trail
  - Enhance existing `AttendanceListView.tsx` - Add finalization status indicators
- Finalization API: `app/api/attendance/` (extend existing)
  - `finalization/route.ts` - Period finalization and unlock operations
  - `periods/route.ts` - Period status queries and management
- Period Types: `types/attendance.ts` (extend existing types)
  - Add AttendancePeriod, FinalizationRequest, and PeriodStatus interfaces

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
**Naming Conventions**:
- Components: PascalCase (AttendanceFinalizationModal, AttendancePeriodStatus, AttendancePeriodHistory)
- Hooks: camelCase with 'use' prefix (useAttendanceFinalization, usePeriodStatus)
- API Routes: kebab-case following established patterns
- Database Operations: Follow established Prisma transaction patterns for period finalization
- Type Definitions: PascalCase following existing attendance type patterns

**Development Patterns**:
- Environment Variables: Access through config objects, never process.env directly
- Error Handling: All finalization operations must use standard error handler patterns
- State Management: Use Zustand for finalization workflow state and real-time period status updates
- API Patterns: Follow established Server Action patterns for finalization and period operations

### Project Structure Notes
Finalization workflow system builds directly on the approval foundation from Story 5.5b with AttendanceRecord approval status ready for finalization validation. Component organization follows existing attendance module structure in src/components/business/attendance/. Database design introduces new AttendancePeriod model with relationships to existing AttendanceRecord table. UI components extend existing shadcn/ui patterns with enhanced period management forms and status interfaces. Authentication and authorization follow established NextAuth.js admin role patterns. Notification integration uses existing Notification Service patterns for Accounts team alerts. Testing follows established Jest + Testing Library + Supertest patterns. Integration prepares foundation for upcoming payroll calculation workflow (Story 5.7a) with comprehensive finalized period data and status tracking.
