### Data Model Requirements
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#document]
Document interface established for receivable integration:
```typescript
interface Document {
  id: string;
  originalName: string;
  storedPath: string;
  category: DocumentCategory;
  fileSize: number;
  mimeType: string;
  uploadedById: string;
  linkedToCustomerId: string | null;
  linkedToReceivableId: string | null;
  linkedToSalesReportId: string | null;
  createdAt: Date;
  
  // Relationships
  uploadedBy: User;
  linkedToCustomer?: Customer;
  linkedToReceivable?: Receivable;
  linkedToSalesReport?: SalesReport;
}

enum DocumentCategory {
  INVOICE = 'INVOICE',        // INV.xxxx pattern
  PURCHASE_ORDER = 'PURCHASE_ORDER',  // PO.xxxx pattern  
  DELIVERY_ORDER = 'DELIVERY_ORDER',  // DO.xxxx pattern
  SALES_RECEIPT = 'SALES_RECEIPT',
  OTHER = 'OTHER'
}
```

Document upload and display component interfaces:
```typescript
interface DocumentUploadProps {
  receivableId: string;
  onUploadComplete: (documents: Document[]) => void;
  onUploadError: (error: string) => void;
  maxFiles?: number;
  acceptedTypes?: string[];
  maxFileSize?: number; // bytes
  currentUserRole: UserRole;
}

interface DocumentListProps {
  documents: Document[];
  currentUserRole: UserRole;
  receivableId: string;
  showActions?: boolean;
  onDocumentRemove?: (documentId: string) => Promise<void>;
  onDocumentDownload?: (documentId: string) => Promise<void>;
  loading?: boolean;
}

interface DocumentFormData {
  files: File[];
  receivableId: string;
  category?: DocumentCategory;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### Document Management Service Integration  
[Source: architecture/components.md#document-management-service]
Document Management Service interfaces for receivable integration:
- `uploadFiles(files, metadata)` - Process multiple file uploads with validation for receivable linking
- `categorizeDocument(filename)` - Automatic pattern recognition (DO.xxxx, PO.xxxx, INV.xxxx) for receivable documents
- `linkDocumentToEntity(docId, entityId, entityType)` - Connect documents to receivables with proper relationship management
- `generatePreviewUrl(docId)` - Secure document preview URLs with user authorization for receivable documents

### Frontend Architecture Integration
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
Component architecture for document-receivable integration:
- Business components: `src/components/business/DocumentUpload.tsx` (new component)
- Document display: `src/components/business/DocumentList.tsx` (new component)  
- Enhanced receivable components: Update existing ReceivableForm and ReceivableListTable components
- Server Actions: `src/lib/actions/documents.ts` (new action file for receivable document operations)
- Type definitions: Enhanced `types/document.ts` with receivable integration interfaces

### shadcn/ui Component Integration
Required shadcn/ui components for document-receivable integration:
- **Button**: Upload triggers, download actions, and document management operations
- **Dialog**: Document preview modals and confirmation dialogs for document operations
- **Progress**: File upload progress indicators for large document uploads
- **Badge**: Document type indicators (Invoice, PO, DO) and status displays
- **Card**: Document metadata display cards within receivable detail views
- **Separator**: Visual separation between document sections and receivable information
- **Tooltip**: Document action explanations and file information hover details
- **Alert**: Upload error messages and validation feedback for document operations

Enhanced DocumentList component for receivable integration:
```typescript
interface DocumentListProps {
  documents: Document[];
  receivableId: string;
  currentUserRole: UserRole;
  showUploadZone?: boolean;
  allowRemoval?: boolean;
  allowDownload?: boolean;
  groupByCategory?: boolean;
  sortBy?: 'date' | 'name' | 'category';
  sortOrder?: 'asc' | 'desc';
  onDocumentUpload?: (files: File[]) => Promise<void>;
  onDocumentRemove?: (documentId: string) => Promise<void>;
  onDocumentPreview?: (documentId: string) => void;
  onBulkDownload?: (documentIds: string[]) => Promise<void>;
  loading?: boolean;
}
```

### Server Action Integration  
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
Document Server Actions for receivable integration:

```typescript
// Upload documents with automatic receivable linking
export async function uploadDocumentsForReceivableAction(
  formData: FormData,
  receivableId: string
): Promise<ActionResult<Document[]>>

// Link existing document to receivable
export async function linkDocumentToReceivableAction(
  documentId: string,
  receivableId: string
): Promise<ActionResult<Document>>

// Remove document from receivable (unlink, not delete)
export async function unlinkDocumentFromReceivableAction(
  documentId: string,
  receivableId: string
): Promise<ActionResult<void>>

// Get all documents linked to specific receivable
export async function getReceivableDocumentsAction(
  receivableId: string
): Promise<ActionResult<Document[]>>

// Generate secure download URL for receivable document
export async function generateDocumentDownloadUrlAction(
  documentId: string,
  receivableId: string
): Promise<ActionResult<{ downloadUrl: string; expiresAt: Date }>>

// Bulk document operations for receivables
export async function bulkLinkDocumentsAction(
  documentIds: string[],
  receivableId: string
): Promise<ActionResult<Document[]>>
```

### Database Schema Integration
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
Document table already supports receivable linking through linkedToReceivableId field:
```sql
-- Documents table with receivable relationship support
CREATE TABLE documents (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    original_name VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    stored_path VARCHAR(1000) NOT NULL,
    category document_category NOT NULL,
    file_size BIGINT NOT NULL,
    mime_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    uploaded_by_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    linked_to_customer_id UUID REFERENCES customers(id),
    linked_to_receivable_id UUID REFERENCES receivables(id),
    linked_to_sales_report_id UUID REFERENCES sales_reports(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    
    -- File constraints
    CONSTRAINT valid_file_size CHECK (file_size > 0 AND file_size <= 10485760) -- 10MB limit
);

-- Performance indexes for document-receivable operations
CREATE INDEX idx_documents_receivable_category ON documents(linked_to_receivable_id, category);
CREATE INDEX idx_documents_receivable_date ON documents(linked_to_receivable_id, created_at);
```

Document query patterns for receivable operations:
- Receivable documents: `WHERE linked_to_receivable_id = $receivableId ORDER BY created_at DESC`
- Document search by type: `WHERE linked_to_receivable_id = $receivableId AND category = $category`
- Recent documents: `WHERE linked_to_receivable_id = $receivableId ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10`

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure:
- Document upload component: `src/components/business/DocumentUpload.tsx` (new component)
- Document list component: `src/components/business/DocumentList.tsx` (new component)  
- Enhanced receivable form: Update existing `src/components/business/ReceivableForm.tsx`
- Enhanced receivable table: Update existing `src/components/business/ReceivableListTable.tsx`
- Document server actions: `src/lib/actions/documents.ts` (new action file)
- Document type definitions: Enhanced `types/document.ts` with receivable interfaces
- Document component tests: `src/__tests__/components/business/DocumentUpload.test.tsx` (new test file)
- Document list tests: `src/__tests__/components/business/DocumentList.test.tsx` (new test file)  
- Document action tests: `src/__tests__/actions/documents.test.ts` (new test file)
- Document integration tests: `src/__tests__/integration/document-receivable-flow.test.ts` (new integration test)

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Type Sharing**: Define Document-Receivable interfaces in shared types directory for component consistency
- **API Calls**: Use Server Actions exclusively for document operations, never direct HTTP calls or blob API calls from frontend
- **Environment Variables**: Access Vercel Blob configuration through config objects for storage operations
- **Error Handling**: Document components must handle Server Action errors using established error patterns with user feedback
- **State Updates**: Use proper useState and Zustand patterns for document upload state, never mutate document arrays directly
- **Naming Conventions**: Document components use PascalCase, document handlers use camelCase with 'handle' prefix

### Technical Constraints
- File size limit of 10MB per document enforced by database constraint and frontend validation
- Supported file types: PDF, images (JPG, PNG), Excel files (XLS, XLSX) with MIME type validation
- Document uploads must be linked to existing receivables only, no orphaned documents allowed
- Document access requires proper user authentication and receivable access permissions
- Document previews must use secure, time-limited URLs from Vercel Blob storage
- Multiple document uploads must be processed as transactions to ensure data consistency
- Document removal operations are unlink operations only, actual file deletion requires separate admin process
- Document search must support filename and content indexing for business document discovery
- All document operations must maintain audit trails for compliance and security requirements

### Project Structure Notes
Current Next.js App Router structure supports document management integration within existing receivable workflows. Component architecture supports new document components in existing `src/components/business/` directory alongside receivable components. Server Actions pattern allows secure document operations with role-based access control. Database schema supports document-receivable relationships through established foreign key constraints without structural modifications needed. Vercel Blob storage integration ready for production document storage with proper CDN delivery.
