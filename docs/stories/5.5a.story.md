- Role-based middleware validation for all attendance edit and update endpoints
- Session management integration following established NextAuth.js patterns
- Comprehensive audit trail for all manual edits with user identification and timestamping

### Time Validation and Business Rules
**Attendance Edit Validation System**:
- Time sequence validation ensuring clock-in occurs before clock-out for logical consistency
- Working hour constraints based on department policies and overtime calculation rules
- Date validation preventing future date entries and maintaining historical accuracy
- Integration with existing Staff model for department-specific shift schedule validation
- Real-time validation feedback with clear error messages following shadcn/ui patterns

### Audit Trail and Accountability
**Manual Edit Tracking**:
- Complete audit trail for all manual attendance edits using existing conflict resolution fields
- Edit reason tracking for accountability and compliance with HR policies
- User identification and timestamp logging for all modifications using established User relationships
- Integration with existing AttendanceRecord conflict tracking for comprehensive edit history

### Integration with Existing System
**Building on Previous Stories**:

- Hooks: camelCase with 'use' prefix (useAttendanceEdit, useTimeValidation)
- API Routes: kebab-case following established patterns
- Database Operations: Follow established Prisma transaction patterns
- Type Definitions: PascalCase following existing attendance type patterns

**Development Patterns**:
- Environment Variables: Access through config objects, never process.env directly
- Error Handling: All attendance edit operations must use standard error handler
- State Management: Use Zustand for edit form state and optimistic updates
- API Patterns: Follow established Server Action patterns for edit operations

### Project Structure Notes
Attendance edit system builds directly on the display foundation from Story 5.4 with AttendanceListView and EmployeeAttendanceHistory components ready for edit integration. Component organization follows existing attendance module structure in src/components/business/attendance/. Database updates utilize existing conflict resolution and audit fields. UI components extend existing shadcn/ui patterns with enhanced form validation and modal interfaces. Authentication and authorization follow established NextAuth.js admin role patterns. Testing follows established Jest + Testing Library + Supertest patterns. Integration prepares foundation for upcoming approval workflow (Story 5.5b) with comprehensive edit tracking and audit trail.
