### HR Attendance Service Requirements
[Source: architecture/components.md#hr-attendance-service]
**Attendance Data Display Service**:
- `getAttendanceRecords(filters)` - Retrieve filtered attendance data with pagination support
- `getEmployeeAttendanceHistory(staffId, dateRange)` - Individual employee attendance timeline
- `generateAttendanceSummary(type, period)` - Daily/weekly/monthly summary calculations
- Dependencies: AttendanceRecord model (from Stories 5.3a/5.3b), Staff model relationships, PostgreSQL indexing
- Technology Stack: Prisma queries with filtering, Next.js Server Actions, shadcn/ui data tables

### Frontend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
**Component Organization**: 
- Attendance display components organized in src/components/business/attendance/ following established patterns
- Integration with existing AttendanceResults component as foundation for enhanced display functionality
- State management using Zustand for filter persistence and view mode selection
- Responsive design supporting both desktop admin workflows and mobile attendance review

### Data Model Requirements
[Source: existing types/attendance.ts and established AttendanceRecord model]
**AttendanceRecord Display Data**:
- Full integration with existing AttendanceRecord interface including staff relationships
- AttendanceSearchParams and AttendanceSearchResult types already established for filtering operations
- AttendanceStats interface ready for summary view calculations and statistics display
- ProcessedAttendanceRecord types for validation status display and error handling

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: existing prisma/schema.prisma AttendanceRecord model]
**AttendanceRecord Table Queries**:
- Established indexes for efficient filtering: date ranges, staff queries, department filtering
- Staff relationship joins for employee information display and department grouping
- Sync tracking fields (syncJobId, syncedAt, lastSyncStatus) for data validation status display
- Conflict resolution fields (conflictResolved, conflictResolvedBy) for audit trail display

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Attendance Display Components: `src/components/business/attendance/` (extend existing)
  - `AttendanceListView.tsx` - Main attendance listing with filtering
  - `EmployeeAttendanceHistory.tsx` - Individual employee attendance timeline
  - `AttendanceSummaryViews.tsx` - Daily/weekly/monthly summary components
  - Enhance existing `AttendanceResults.tsx` - Use as foundation for enhanced display
- Attendance Review Pages: `app/(dashboard)/attendance/` (extend existing structure)
  - `review/page.tsx` - Main attendance review dashboard page
  - `employee/[staffId]/page.tsx` - Individual employee attendance history page
- Attendance Data API: `app/api/attendance/` (extend existing)
  - `records/route.ts` - Attendance data retrieval with filtering
  - `summary/route.ts` - Summary data calculation endpoint
- Attendance Types: `types/attendance.ts` (already established with comprehensive types)
- Attendance Services: `src/services/` (extend existing)
  - Enhance existing `attendanceService.ts` with display-specific data operations

  - `components/business/attendance/display/` - Display component tests
  - `api/attendance/records/` - Data retrieval API tests
  - `services/attendanceDisplay.test.ts` - Display service tests

### Authentication and Role-Based Access
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#user and backend-architecture.md]
**Role Validation Requirements**:
- All attendance display operations limited to ADMIN role (following established pattern from Stories 5.3a/5.3b)
- Role-based middleware validation for all attendance review and display endpoints
- Session management integration following established NextAuth.js patterns
- Audit trail for attendance data access and export operations

### Data Display and Filtering Strategy
**Multi-Level Attendance Display**:
- List view with real-time filtering by date range, employee, department, and sync status
- Individual employee drill-down with comprehensive attendance history and pattern analysis
- Summary views with statistical calculations ready for payroll processing handoff
- Export functionality for external payroll system integration and record keeping
- Integration with existing AttendanceSearchParams and AttendanceSearchResult types

### Performance and Optimization
**Efficient Data Loading**:
- Pagination for large attendance datasets with established limit/offset patterns
- Database indexing utilization for fast filtering and sorting operations
- Component-level caching for summary calculations and statistical data
- Lazy loading for employee detail views and attendance history timelines
- Export optimization for large date range attendance data processing

### Integration with Existing System
**Building on Previous Stories**:
- Direct integration with AttendanceRecord model and relationships established in Stories 5.1a-5.3b
- Utilization of existing ZKT sync status and job tracking for data validation display
- Integration with Staff model relationships for employee information and department grouping
- Compatibility with established authentication and authorization patterns from previous stories
- Foundation for upcoming manual editing (Story 5.5a) and approval workflows (Story 5.5b)

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
**Naming Conventions**:
- Components: PascalCase (AttendanceListView, EmployeeAttendanceHistory, AttendanceSummaryViews)
- Hooks: camelCase with 'use' prefix (useAttendanceFilter, useAttendanceSummary)
- API Routes: kebab-case following established patterns
- Database Queries: Follow established Prisma repository patterns
- Type Definitions: PascalCase following existing attendance type patterns

**Development Patterns**:
- Environment Variables: Access through config objects, never process.env directly
- Error Handling: All attendance display operations must use standard error handler
- State Management: Use Zustand for filter persistence and view state management
- API Patterns: Follow established Server Action patterns for data retrieval operations

### Project Structure Notes
Attendance display system builds directly on the established AttendanceRecord model and relationships from Stories 5.1a-5.3b. Component organization follows existing attendance module structure in src/components/business/attendance/. Database queries utilize established indexes and relationships. UI components extend existing shadcn/ui patterns with enhanced filtering and summary capabilities. Authentication and authorization follow established NextAuth.js admin role patterns. Testing follows established Jest + Testing Library + Supertest patterns. Integration prepares foundation for upcoming manual editing and approval workflow stories.
