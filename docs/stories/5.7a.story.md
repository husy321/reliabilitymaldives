### Authentication and Role-Based Access
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#user and backend-architecture.md]
**Payroll Access Control Requirements**:
- Payroll calculation operations limited to ACCOUNTS role following established patterns
- ADMIN role access for payroll oversight and audit trail review
- Payroll calculation audit logging with user identification and calculation accountability
- Integration with existing NextAuth.js role-based middleware for payroll route protection

### Notification Service Integration
[Source: architecture/components.md#notification-service]

- Payroll completion notifications with period summary and employee count
- Real-time payroll calculation status updates using established SSE patterns
- Notification history tracking for payroll workflow compliance and audit requirements

### Business Rules and Calculation Logic
**Payroll Calculation Requirements**:
- Standard hours calculated from finalized attendance records within period boundaries
- Overtime calculation based on daily threshold (8+ hours) and weekly threshold (40+ hours)
- Overtime rate calculation typically 1.5x standard rate following labor regulations
- Payroll calculations only permitted on FINALIZED attendance periods from Story 5.6
- Calculation audit trail maintains detailed breakdown for review and compliance
- Payroll period status prevents recalculation without explicit approval workflow

### Integration with Existing System
**Building on Previous Stories**:
- Direct integration with AttendancePeriod and AttendanceRecord models from Story 5.6
- Utilization of existing finalized period validation from AttendanceFinalizationService
- Integration with established Notification Service for Accounts team payroll alerts
- Compatibility with existing authentication, authorization, and database transaction patterns
- Foundation for upcoming payroll export functionality (Story 5.7b) with calculated payroll data

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
**Naming Conventions**:
- Components: PascalCase (PayrollCalculationModal, PayrollSummary, PayrollEmployeeDetail)
- Hooks: camelCase with 'use' prefix (usePayrollCalculation, usePayrollPeriods)
- API Routes: kebab-case following established patterns (payroll/calculation, payroll/records)
- Database Operations: Follow established Prisma transaction patterns for payroll calculation persistence
- Type Definitions: PascalCase following existing business domain type patterns

**Development Patterns**:
- Environment Variables: Access through config objects, never process.env directly
- Error Handling: All payroll calculation operations must use standard error handler patterns
- State Management: Use Zustand for payroll calculation workflow state and real-time status updates
- API Patterns: Follow established Server Action patterns for payroll calculations and approval operations

### Project Structure Notes
Payroll calculation system builds directly on the attendance finalization foundation from Story 5.6 with AttendancePeriod model ready for payroll integration. Component organization introduces new business domain in src/components/business/payroll/ following established patterns. Database design introduces PayrollPeriod and PayrollRecord models with relationships to existing AttendancePeriod and Employee tables. UI components utilize existing shadcn/ui patterns with enhanced calculation forms and result displays. Authentication and authorization follow established NextAuth.js role patterns with ACCOUNTS team access. Notification integration uses existing Notification Service patterns for payroll workflow alerts. Testing follows established Jest + Testing Library + Supertest patterns. Integration prepares foundation for upcoming payroll export functionality (Story 5.7b) with comprehensive calculated payroll data.
