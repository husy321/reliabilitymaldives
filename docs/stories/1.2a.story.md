## Dev Notes

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Authentication: NextAuth.js v4+ for role-based auth system with built-in providers and session management
- Frontend Framework: Next.js 14+ with App Router for fullstack React framework
- UI Component Library: shadcn/ui v4 for professional business UI with Form components
- Frontend Language: TypeScript 5.0+ for type-safe development

### Backend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- Authentication and Authorization: NextAuth.js integration with role-based middleware, session management, and comprehensive security features
- Service Architecture: Next.js API Routes with controller organization by business domain

### Frontend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Routing Architecture: Next.js App Router with route groups for authentication and protected dashboard routes
- Component Organization: Components organized in src/components/ with forms/ for form components
- State Management: Local useState for UI-specific state, later integration with Zustand for global state

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
Users table structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role user_role NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Components: Use PascalCase naming (e.g., LoginForm.tsx)
- Environment Variables: Access only through config objects, never process.env directly
- Error Handling: All API routes must use the standard error handler

### File Locations
- NextAuth configuration: `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
- Login page: `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`
- Login form component: `src/components/forms/LoginForm.tsx`
- Authentication utilities: `src/lib/auth.ts`
- Type definitions: `types/auth.ts`

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Frontend Testing: Jest + Testing Library 29+/13+ for component testing
- Backend Testing: Jest + Supertest 29+/6+ for API testing
- Test authentication flows, form validation, and error scenarios

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test file location: `src/__tests__/components/forms/LoginForm.test.tsx` and `src/__tests__/api/auth/`
- Test standards: Jest + Testing Library for React components, Jest + Supertest for API routes
- Testing frameworks: Jest 29+ and Testing Library 13+ with TypeScript support
- Specific requirements: Test login form validation, authentication API endpoints, session management, and error handling
