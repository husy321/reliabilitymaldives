## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.1a completion:
- File upload Server Action implemented in `src/lib/actions/documents.ts`
- Basic multipart form data processing established
- Document model exists in Prisma schema with proper relationships
- File storage system with category-based organization implemented
- Foundation for validation is in place but needs security enhancements

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Backend Language: TypeScript v5.0+ for unified language stack across project
- Backend Framework: Next.js API Routes v14+ for serverless API endpoints
- API Style: Server Actions + REST - Server Actions for form processing and mutations
- File Storage: Vercel Blob (Latest) for document storage with integrated CDN
- Database: PostgreSQL v15+ for ACID compliance and financial data integrity
- Backend Testing: Jest v29+ + Supertest v6+ for API and integration testing

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md#backend-security]
- Comprehensive input validation with Zod schemas
- Role-based access control with middleware
- Rate limiting and CORS policies for API protection
- File validation must prevent malicious uploads and MIME type spoofing

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
Current Document table structure with size constraints:
```sql
CREATE TABLE documents (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    original_name VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    stored_path VARCHAR(1000) NOT NULL,
    category document_category NOT NULL,
    file_size BIGINT NOT NULL,
    mime_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    uploaded_by_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    linked_to_customer_id UUID REFERENCES customers(id),
    linked_to_receivable_id UUID REFERENCES receivables(id),
    linked_to_sales_report_id UUID REFERENCES sales_reports(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    
    CONSTRAINT valid_file_size CHECK (file_size > 0 AND file_size <= 10485760) -- 10MB limit
);
```

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#document]
Document TypeScript interface with validation requirements:
```typescript
interface Document {
  id: string;
  originalName: string;
  storedPath: string;
  category: DocumentCategory;
  fileSize: number;
  mimeType: string;
  uploadedById: string;
  linkedToCustomerId: string | null;
  linkedToReceivableId: string | null;
  linkedToSalesReportId: string | null;
  createdAt: Date;
  
  // Relationships
  uploadedBy: User;
  linkedToCustomer?: Customer;
  linkedToReceivable?: Receivable;
  linkedToSalesReport?: SalesReport;
}

enum DocumentCategory {
  INVOICE = 'INVOICE',        // INV.xxxx/xx pattern
  PURCHASE_ORDER = 'PURCHASE_ORDER',  // PO.xxxx/xx pattern  
  DELIVERY_ORDER = 'DELIVERY_ORDER',  // DO.xxxx/xx pattern
  SALES_RECEIPT = 'SALES_RECEIPT',
  OTHER = 'OTHER'
}
```

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md#nextjs-server-actions-primary]
Server Action pattern requiring validation enhancements:
```typescript
// Enhanced Server Actions for document upload (src/lib/actions/documents.ts)
export async function uploadDocumentAction(formData: FormData): Promise<ActionResult<Document>> {
  const files = formData.getAll('files') as File[];
  const customerId = formData.get('customerId') as string;
  const category = formData.get('category') as DocumentCategory;
  
  try {
    // Enhanced validation: file format, size, security checks
    await validateFiles(files); // New validation function needed
    const documents = await uploadDocuments(files, customerId, category);
    revalidatePath('/documents');
    return { success: true, data: documents };
  } catch (error) {
    return { success: false, error: error.message };
  }
}

type ActionResult<T> = {
  success: true;
  data: T;
} | {
  success: false;
  error: string;
}
```

### File Locations
Based on current flat Next.js project structure:
- Server Actions: `src/lib/actions/documents.ts` (extend existing implementation)
- Validation utilities: `src/lib/validation/` (new directory for validation logic)
- Database models: Already defined in `prisma/schema.prisma` (potential extensions needed)
- Tests: `src/__tests__/actions/` and `src/__tests__/validation/` following current test structure
- Types: `types/document.ts` (extend existing document types)

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Type Sharing**: Define types in shared location, import consistently
- **API Calls**: Never make direct HTTP calls - use service layer
- **Environment Variables**: Access only through config objects, never process.env directly
- **Error Handling**: All Server Actions must use standard ActionResult pattern
- **State Updates**: Never mutate state directly - use proper state management patterns
- **Naming Conventions**: Server Actions use camelCase, database tables use snake_case

### Technical Constraints
- File size limit: 10MB maximum per file (enforced by database constraint)
- Allowed file formats: PDF, JPG, PNG, DOC, DOCX for business documents only
- Must validate MIME types and file signatures to prevent spoofing
- All file operations must be async with proper error handling
- Server Actions must return ActionResult type for consistent error handling
- Must integrate with existing authentication system for user tracking

### Project Structure Notes
Current project uses flat Next.js structure instead of documented monorepo structure. All file paths reflect actual project structure with root-level `src/`, `prisma/`, and `types/` directories. No conflicts identified with story requirements.

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Backend Unit Testing: Jest v29+ for Server Action and validation logic testing
- Integration Testing: Jest + Supertest for file validation workflow testing
- Test files location: Create tests in `src/__tests__/actions/` and `src/__tests__/validation/`
- Mock file operations and validation logic for unit test isolation
- Test file format validation, size limits, and security measures
- Ensure proper TypeScript types in all test files
- Focus on security validation edge cases and error handling
