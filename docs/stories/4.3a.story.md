## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 4.2 completion:
- SalesReportForm component already exists with single outlet auto-selection
- useOutletSelection hook implemented with single outlet selection and permission validation
- Outlet types well-defined in `types/outlet.ts` with manager relationship validation
- getUserOutletsAction server action ready for fetching manager's assigned outlets
- Outlet permission validation working: managerId === user.id constraint

### Tech Stack Requirements  
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Frontend Framework: Next.js v14+ App Router for component routing and Server Actions
- UI Components: shadcn/ui v4 for professional multi-select and switcher components
- State Management: Zustand v4.4+ for outlet context state across components, localStorage for persistence
- Form Integration: React Hook Form with existing SalesReportForm patterns
- Frontend Testing: Jest + Testing Library v29+/13+ for hook and component testing

### Component Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
**Component Organization**: 
- Business components in `src/components/business/` for OutletContextSwitcher
- Enhanced hooks in `src/hooks/` extending existing useOutletSelection
- Form integration maintains existing `src/components/forms/` patterns

### Outlet Data Model Integration
[Source: architecture/data-models.md and existing types/outlet.ts]
**Outlet Model Usage**:
```typescript
interface Outlet {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  location: string;
  managerId: string;       // Must match current user for permission validation
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface OutletOption {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  location: string;
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

### Multi-Outlet Selection Hook Requirements
**Enhanced useOutletSelection Interface**:
```typescript
interface UseMultiOutletSelectionReturn {
  outlets: OutletOption[];
  selectedOutletIds: string[];        // Multiple selection support
  activeOutletId: string | null;      // Currently active outlet context
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  setSelectedOutletIds: (outletIds: string[]) => void;
  setActiveOutletId: (outletId: string | null) => void;
  refetchOutlets: () => Promise<void>;
}
```

### Outlet Context Switcher Component Requirements
[Source: architecture/components.md and existing patterns]
**OutletContextSwitcher Component**:
- Visual outlet selection with active state indicator
- Outlet information display (name, location) in header
- Smooth transitions when switching between outlets
- Integration with existing shadcn/ui design system
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### Form Integration Requirements
**SalesReportForm Integration**:
- Maintain existing form validation and submission patterns
- Add outlet context awareness to form state management
- Preserve form data during outlet context switches using sessionStorage
- Update form header to show active outlet information
- Ensure outlet validation before form submission

### State Management Architecture
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
**Multi-Outlet State Management**:
- Zustand store for outlet context state across components
- Local storage persistence for selected outlets between sessions
- Session storage for form data during outlet switches
- React Query for server state (outlet data) with existing patterns

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Enhanced Hook: `src/hooks/useMultiOutletSelection.ts` (extend existing useOutletSelection.ts)
- Context Switcher: `src/components/business/OutletContextSwitcher.tsx` (new file)
- Context Store: `src/stores/outletContextStore.ts` (new file using Zustand)
- Form Integration: Update existing `src/components/forms/SalesReportForm.tsx`
- Types: Extend existing `types/outlet.ts` with multi-selection interfaces
- Test Files: `src/__tests__/components/OutletContextSwitcher.test.tsx` (new file)
- Test Files: `src/__tests__/hooks/useMultiOutletSelection.test.tsx` (new file)

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Component Naming**: Use PascalCase for `OutletContextSwitcher.tsx`
- **Hook Naming**: Use camelCase with 'use' prefix for `useMultiOutletSelection.ts`
- **Type Sharing**: Extend existing types in `types/outlet.ts` for consistency
- **State Updates**: Use proper Zustand patterns, never mutate state directly
- **Error Handling**: Follow existing error handling patterns from useOutletSelection

### Authentication and Role-Based Access
[Source: architecture/components.md#authentication-service and previous story insights]
**Role Validation Requirements**:
- Multi-outlet selection only available to managers with multiple assigned outlets
- Outlet context switching validates user has manager permissions for target outlet
- Active outlet context must be validated before any form submissions
- Outlet permission validation: managerId === user.id for all selected outlets

### Project Structure Notes
Component integrates with existing Next.js App Router structure. Hook extends existing useOutletSelection patterns. Form integration maintains established SalesReportForm patterns. Context switching uses Zustand following established state management patterns. Testing follows existing Jest + Testing Library patterns from previous stories.

### API Integration Requirements
**Existing Server Actions Usage**:
- `getUserOutletsAction()` already available for fetching manager's outlets
- Returns OutletOption[] with permission validation built-in
- No new server actions required for basic multi-outlet functionality
- Form submission continues to use existing `submitSalesReportAction` with outlet validation

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Frontend Unit Testing**: Jest + Testing Library v29+/13+ for hook and component testing
- **Test Locations**:
  - `src/__tests__/hooks/useMultiOutletSelection.test.tsx` - Enhanced hook multi-selection logic and state management
  - `src/__tests__/components/OutletContextSwitcher.test.tsx` - Context switcher component interactions and visual feedback
- **Testing Scenarios**:
  - Multi-outlet selection and deselection logic
  - Outlet context switching with state persistence
  - Permission validation for multiple outlet managers
  - Form integration with outlet context switching
  - Local storage and session storage persistence
  - Error handling for invalid outlet selections
  - Component visual feedback and animations
  - Integration with existing SalesReportForm functionality
