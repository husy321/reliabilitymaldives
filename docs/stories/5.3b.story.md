### Data Model Requirements
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
**AttendanceRecord Data Model (Extension)**:
- Integration with existing Staff model for employee identification (established in Story 5.3a)
- ZKT machine data mapping and validation requirements with duplicate prevention
- Support for automated sync operations with conflict resolution capabilities
- Relationship with Staff model for employee mapping validation (already established)

**AttendanceRecord Table Schema Requirements** (Extending Story 5.3a schema):
- Unique constraint enhancement: (staffId, date, zkTransactionId) for duplicate prevention
- Additional indexing for automated sync queries: date ranges and sync status tracking
- Job execution tracking fields: syncJobId, syncedAt, lastSyncStatus
- Conflict resolution fields: conflictResolved, conflictResolvedBy, conflictNotes

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
**AttendanceRecord Table Enhancement**:
- Extend unique constraint on (staffId, date, zkTransactionId) for comprehensive duplicate prevention
- Add database indexes for performance: automated sync queries (date, syncStatus), job tracking (syncJobId)
- Check constraints for data validation: sync status validation, conflict resolution tracking
- Foreign key relationships for job tracking and conflict resolution audit trails

### External API Integration Requirements
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md]
**ZKT Machine API Integration (Automated)**:
- Purpose: Automated daily staff attendance data retrieval for continuous payroll workflow
- Base URL(s): Local network machine IP addresses (typically 192.168.x.x range) - already configured
- Authentication: Machine-specific authentication (SDK dependent) - established in Story 5.3a
- Key Endpoints Used:
  - `GET /attendance/data` - Fetch attendance records by date range (established)
  - `GET /employees` - Retrieve employee list and ID mapping (established)
  - `POST /test-connection` - Verify machine connectivity (established)
- Integration Notes: Building on established ZKT service layer from Story 5.3a with added scheduling capabilities

### Scheduled Job System Requirements
**Job Scheduling Capabilities**:
- Configurable daily sync timing (default: early morning before business hours)
- Multiple ZKT machine support with parallel processing capabilities
- Error recovery with exponential backoff for temporary failures
- Job queue management for handling concurrent sync operations
- Logging and monitoring for operational visibility and troubleshooting

### Duplicate Prevention System Requirements
**Data Validation and Deduplication**:
- Database-level unique constraints for primary duplicate prevention
- Application-level validation for data integrity and conflict detection
- Overlap handling between manual fetch (Story 5.3a) and automated sync operations
- Employee ID mapping validation against Staff model with error reporting
- Data sanitization and validation for incoming attendance records from multiple sources

- Role-based middleware validation for all job configuration and monitoring endpoints
- Session management integration following established NextAuth.js patterns (from Story 5.3a)
- Audit trail for job configuration changes and manual sync triggers

### Duplicate Prevention Strategy
**Multi-Layer Duplicate Prevention**:
- Database unique constraints as primary prevention layer
- Application-level validation for complex conflict scenarios
- Manual vs. automated sync conflict resolution with admin override capabilities
- ZKT transaction ID tracking for machine-specific duplicate prevention
- Employee mapping validation consistency across sync sources

### Error Handling and Recovery
**Automated Sync Error Management**:
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for temporary failures
- Error notification system for persistent sync failures requiring admin attention
- Fallback to manual sync capabilities when automated system encounters issues
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting sync failures and performance monitoring
- Job failure recovery with configurable retry limits and escalation procedures

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
**Naming Conventions**:
- Components: PascalCase (JobMonitoringDashboard, SyncConfiguration)
- Hooks: camelCase with 'use' prefix (useJobMonitoring, useSyncConfiguration)
- API Routes: kebab-case following established patterns
- Database Tables: snake_case (attendance_sync_jobs)
- Type Definitions: PascalCase following type sharing patterns

**Development Patterns**:
- Environment Variables: Access through config objects, never process.env directly
- Error Handling: All automated sync operations must use standard error handler
- State Management: Use Zustand for job monitoring UI state and configuration data
- API Patterns: Follow established Server Action patterns for job management operations

### Project Structure Notes
Automated attendance sync system extends the manual fetch system from Story 5.3a. Job scheduling system follows established Next.js API route patterns. Database schema builds on existing AttendanceRecord model with enhanced unique constraints. UI components follow established shadcn/ui component organization in attendance module. Authentication and authorization use existing NextAuth.js admin role-based access patterns. Testing follows established Jest + Testing Library + Supertest patterns from previous stories. Error handling and monitoring integrate with existing service layer patterns.
