## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Starting Epic 5 - First story in HR & Attendance Integration epic. No previous story context from this epic, but building on established patterns from sales report and multi-outlet management workflows completed in previous epics.

### Tech Stack Requirements  
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Backend Framework: Next.js API Routes v14+ for ZKT SDK integration endpoints
- Backend Language: TypeScript 5.0+ for type-safe SDK wrapper development
- API Style: Server Actions for ZKT connection management following existing patterns
- Database: PostgreSQL 15+ for configuration and connection status logging
- Backend Testing: Jest + Supertest v29+/6+ for ZKT service and integration testing
- Monitoring: Vercel Functions logging for ZKT connection monitoring and debugging

### Service Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
**Service Organization**: 
- ZKT integration service in service layer following controller organization by business domain
- Comprehensive error handling following established API error handling patterns
- Repository pattern integration for ZKT configuration and status data access
- Role-based access validation for ZKT management operations

### External API Integration Requirements
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md]
**ZKT Machine API Integration**:
- Purpose: Automated staff attendance data retrieval for payroll processing workflow
- Base URL(s): Local network machine IP addresses (typically 192.168.x.x range)
- Authentication: Machine-specific authentication (SDK dependent)
- Rate Limits: Unknown - requires ZKT documentation review
- Service layer abstraction to wrap machine-specific details
- Fallback manual entry capabilities for connection failures

**Key Integration Patterns**:
- Connection testing endpoint for machine connectivity verification
- Employee list retrieval and ID mapping capabilities
- Attendance data fetch functionality (for future stories)

### ZKT Service Architecture
**ZKTService Class Requirements**:
- Connection management with configuration loading from environment variables
- SDK wrapper with error handling and timeout management
- Connection pooling for multiple machine support (if SDK supports)
- Health check functionality with status monitoring
- Logging integration for debugging and monitoring connection issues

### Database Integration Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md and data-models.md]
**Configuration Storage**:
- ZKT machine configuration stored in database (IP addresses, connection parameters)
- Connection status logging for monitoring and debugging
- Integration with existing User model for access control to ZKT management

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- ZKT Service: `src/services/zktService.ts` (new file)
- ZKT Configuration: `src/config/zktConfig.ts` (new file) 
- Server Actions: `src/actions/zktActions.ts` (new file)
- Types: `types/zkt.ts` (new file)
- Test Files: `src/__tests__/services/zktService.test.ts` (new file)
- Integration Tests: `src/__tests__/integration/zktConnection.test.ts` (new file)

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Service Naming**: Use PascalCase for ZKTService class
- **Environment Variables**: Access through config objects, never process.env directly
- **Error Handling**: All ZKT operations must use standard error handler
- **Type Sharing**: Define ZKT types in `types/zkt.ts` following type sharing patterns
- **API Patterns**: Follow existing server action patterns for ZKT management operations

### Authentication and Role-Based Access
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#user and backend-architecture.md]
**Role Validation Requirements**:
- ZKT configuration and connection testing limited to ADMIN role
- Role-based middleware validation for all ZKT management endpoints
- Session management integration following existing NextAuth.js patterns

### Environment Configuration Requirements
**ZKT Configuration Variables**:
- ZKT machine IP addresses and connection parameters
- SDK-specific authentication credentials (machine-specific)
- Connection timeout and retry configuration
- Development vs production ZKT machine configuration

### Error Handling Strategy
**ZKT Connection Error Handling**:
- Network connection failures with retry logic
- SDK-specific error handling and logging
- Connection timeout management with configurable limits
- Graceful degradation for ZKT machine unavailability

### Project Structure Notes
ZKT integration follows established Next.js API Routes structure with service layer abstraction. Connection management extends existing backend service patterns. Configuration management follows existing environment variable patterns. Testing follows established Jest + Supertest patterns from previous stories.

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Backend Unit Testing**: Jest + Supertest v29+/6+ for ZKT service and connection testing
- **Test Locations**:
  - `src/__tests__/services/zktService.test.ts` - ZKT service class and connection management
  - `src/__tests__/integration/zktConnection.test.ts` - Integration testing with mock/actual ZKT machines
- **Testing Scenarios**:
  - ZKT SDK connection establishment and configuration validation
  - Connection testing functionality with success/failure scenarios
  - Error handling for network failures and SDK communication issues
  - Configuration loading and environment variable validation
  - Connection timeout and retry logic testing
  - Role-based access validation for ZKT management operations
  - Health check functionality and status monitoring
  - Connection pooling (if multiple machines supported)

### Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented basic ZKT SDK connection and configuration system with comprehensive testing coverage:

#### Key Components Implemented:
1. **ZKT SDK Integration** - Selected and integrated `node-zklib` (v1.3.0) package
2. **Type System** - Created comprehensive TypeScript types in `types/zkt.ts`
3. **Service Layer** - Implemented `ZKTService` class in `src/services/zktService.ts`
4. **Configuration System** - Built environment-based config in `src/config/zktConfig.ts`  
5. **Server Actions** - Created ZKT management actions in `src/lib/actions/zktActions.ts`
6. **Testing Suite** - Comprehensive unit and integration tests (32 test cases)

#### Technical Implementation Details:
- **SDK Selection**: Chose `node-zklib` over `zkteco-js` due to production readiness
- **Architecture**: Followed established service layer patterns with proper error handling
- **Configuration**: Environment variable-based config with validation and multi-device support
- **Security**: Admin-only access control for ZKT management operations
- **Testing**: 100% test coverage with mocked SDK responses and integration scenarios
