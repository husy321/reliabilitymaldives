2. Role-based middleware for protecting API routes and pages
3. User role assignment functionality in authentication flow
4. Role-based menu rendering in navigation components

## Story 1.2c: Session Management and Security

**As a system user,**
**I want secure session handling with automatic logout,**
**so that my account remains protected when inactive.**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Session state management throughout the application
2. Automatic logout after 2 hours of inactivity
3. Password hashing with bcrypt implementation
4. Secure session cookies configuration
5. Logout functionality with proper session cleanup

## Story 1.3: Basic Dashboard Framework

**As any authenticated user,**
**I want a role-based dashboard with navigation,**

2. Navigation sidebar with role-based menu items (Receivables, Sales Reports, HR)
3. Dashboard widgets framework for role-specific information display
4. Responsive design working on desktop and mobile devices
5. User profile section showing current user name and role
6. Basic notification area placeholder for future workflow alerts
7. Quick access buttons adapting to user's role permissions

## Story 1.4: Database Schema Foundation

**As a developer,**
**I want core database tables established with proper relationships,**
**so that all business modules have foundational data structures.**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Users table with authentication fields and role assignments
2. Roles table with permission definitions and descriptions
3. Audit log table for tracking system activities with timestamps
4. Prisma migrations configured and tested
5. Seed data script for initial roles (Admin, Accountant, Sales, Manager)
6. Foreign key relationships established between Users and Roles
7. Database backup strategy documented for production
