## Background Context
Reliability Maldives currently operates with manual, paper-based processes across three critical business functions: receivables management, sales reporting, and human resources. The company faces significant operational inefficiencies where staff spend considerable time searching through physical documents, coordinating between departments, and managing customer follow-ups manually. The lack of digital accessibility prevents remote work capabilities that are essential for a small company where every person is critical for business continuity.

The receivables process requires coordination between Sales and Accounts teams for document uploads and customer follow-up management, including conversation logging and automated due date tracking. Sales reporting needs structured approval workflows where managers upload reports for accountant review, with correction cycles when reports are rejected. The HR function must integrate with ZKT attendance machines while allowing administrative adjustments, feeding into payroll processing handled by the Accounts team. Additionally, the company needs customer-facing capabilities including statement generation and export functionality for improved customer service and transparency.
