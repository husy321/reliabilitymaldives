## Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS:**
- None identified - PRD is ready for architecture phase

**HIGH:**
- ZKT machine SDK documentation and API specifications needed
- Customer statement format and branding requirements need specification (PDF format specified)

**MEDIUM:**
- Error handling flows for network failures and system outages need documentation
- Backup and recovery strategy details need expansion
- Performance benchmarks for file upload targets need validation

**LOW:**
- Accessibility testing approach could be more detailed
- Change management process for requirement updates could be defined

## MVP Scope Assessment

**Scope Appropriateness:** ✅ **Just Right**
- Core business pain points directly addressed
- Each epic delivers substantial business value
- Features build logically on each other
- Complexity managed through proper story breakdown

**Features Appropriately Included:**
- Single-window coordination interfaces
- Drag-and-drop file uploads
- Role-based approval workflows
- Cross-team notifications
- Customer statement generation

**No Features Recommended for Removal:** All features address core operational inefficiencies identified in brainstorming session

## Technical Readiness

**Architecture Constraints:** ✅ **Clear**
- Next.js v14+ with shadcn/ui v4 specified
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM defined
- Monolith architecture appropriate for team size
- Role-based access control well-defined

**Identified Technical Risks:**
- ZKT SDK integration complexity unknown
- File upload performance targets may need adjustment based on network conditions
- Notification system implementation approach needs architect review

**Areas Needing Architect Investigation:**
- ZKT machine SDK capabilities and limitations
- Optimal file storage strategy (local vs cloud)
- Real-time notification implementation approach
- Scheduled job architecture in Next.js environment

## Recommendations

**Before Architecture Phase:**
1. **Obtain ZKT SDK documentation** - Critical for Epic 5 technical design
2. **Define customer statement format** - Needed for Epic 3 design specifications (PDF format specified)

**For Architecture Phase:**
1. **Validate 30-second upload target** - Test with actual file sizes and network conditions
2. **Design notification system architecture** - Real-time vs polling approaches
3. **Plan scheduled job implementation** - Next.js limitations and alternatives

**For Implementation:**
1. **Prioritize ZKT integration early** - Highest technical risk area
2. **Implement file upload MVP first** - Core functionality for all modules
3. **Test cross-team coordination workflows** - Critical business process validation

## Final Decision

**✅ READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The identified gaps are specification details that can be addressed during architecture phase rather than blockers to proceeding.
