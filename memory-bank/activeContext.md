## Current Issue: Hydration Error Fixed
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### Problem
The application was experiencing a React hydration error during initial load:
- **Error:** "A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties"
- **Location:** `app/(auth)/layout.tsx` line 13 (body element)
- **Cause:** Duplicate HTML structure definition in route group layout

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by having both:
1. **Root Layout** (`app/layout.tsx`) - Properly defines `<html>` and `<body>` with Inter font className
2. **Auth Route Group Layout** (`app/(auth)/layout.tsx`) - Incorrectly re-defined `<html>` and `<body>` without font className

This created a mismatch between server-rendered HTML (with font class) and client-side React (without font class).

### Solution Applied
1. **Fixed Auth Layout** - Removed `<html>` and `<body>` tags from `app/(auth)/layout.tsx`
2. **Proper Structure** - Auth layout now only wraps children with a styled div
3. **Consistent Styling** - Background styling moved from login page to auth layout
4. **Metadata Update** - Updated auth layout metadata to be more descriptive

### Files Modified
- ✅ `app/(auth)/layout.tsx` - Removed HTML/body tags, added proper wrapper
- ✅ `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - Removed duplicate background styling

## Routing Structure Issue: RESOLVED ✅
**Status:** RESOLVED

### New Problem Discovered
After fixing hydration, discovered **dual app directory structure** causing 404 errors:
- `/app/` directory with basic auth routes (conflicting)
- `/src/app/` directory with complete dashboard system

### Solution Applied
1. **Consolidated Structure** - Moved auth routes from `/app` to `/src/app`
2. **Removed Conflict** - Deleted the conflicting `/app` directory entirely
3. **Unified Routes** - All routes now properly resolve through `/src/app`
4. **CSS Fixed** - Single globals.css in `/src/app/globals.css` with complete Tailwind setup

### Files Modified
- ✅ Removed conflicting `/app` directory structure entirely
- ✅ Updated `/src/app/page.tsx` to redirect to login
- ✅ Reverted unnecessary next.config.ts changes
- ✅ Resolved duplicate login route conflict (kept `/src/app/login/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Removed unnecessary auth route group

## Route Conflict Resolution: FINAL ✅
**Issue:** Duplicate login routes causing Next.js compilation error
- `/src/app/login/page.tsx` (existing, complete)
- `/src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` (duplicate created)

**Solution:** Kept existing `/src/app/login/page.tsx` and removed duplicates

## Final Status: ALL ISSUES RESOLVED ✅
- ✅ Hydration error fixed
- ✅ Dashboard 404 resolved  
- ✅ CSS loading working
- ✅ Route conflicts eliminated

## Final Architecture Notes
- **Single App Directory:** Only `/src/app` for all routes
- **Route Groups:** `(auth)` for login, dashboard routes for authenticated users
- **CSS Loading:** Geist fonts and complete Tailwind variables in single globals.css
- **Authentication:** Preserved existing NextAuth configuration and redirect flow
